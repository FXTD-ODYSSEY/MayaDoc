      <h2><a name="hSynopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>
      <p id="synopsis"> <code>alias 
&lt;aliasName&gt; &lt;commandName&gt; [ arg_1 ... arg_n ] or { list-of-statements }

      <p>alias is undoable, <b>NOT queryable</b>, and <b>NOT editable</b>.</p>
      MEL aliases don't work exactly like csh aliases.  When MEL sees the
use of an alias, it doesn't replace the alias name with the text of
what it is aliased with and rescan that. It can't do that. It isn't a
command line interpreter like csh is. When MEL sees an alias command,
it enters the name into the same procedure table with the regular user
written MEL procedures and it keeps a pointer to the argument list
passed to it (in the case of the first syntax). When someone uses name
in a script, it is processed just like a procedure call. You cannot
pass arguments to an alias specified as a statement list.
<p>
MEL is an interpreter in the sense that it generates a data structure
instead of real machine code.  Instead of having your machine execute
the output, MEL executes it by interpreting the data structure it
generated for your code.  Shell interpreters execute input as it is
being read in. This allows them to do text replacement on the
fly. Fortunately MEL has procedures which make up for any
functionality that is missing from its own version of aliases.
<p>
<b>Special Notes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>You can nest aliases.</li>
<p>
<li>You can't use variables in aliases. This is because MEL isn't a
command line interpreter. If you were to alias to something which used
to a local variable, MEL wouldn't be able to detect when the access of
that variable was out of scope. It is difficult (read: expensive) for
MEL to detect these sorts of errors, so user beware.</li>
<p>
<li>Aliases have the same scope as the procedures/commands which they
alias.  If you alias a local procedure, the alias will become
unavailable when the local procedure goes out of scope.</li>
<p>
<li>&quot;alias&quot; is a directive and not a command.  The alias is created
when the script is read, not when it is actually executed.  So, you
cannot put an &quot;alias&quot; directive in an if statement have it created or
not based on the code path taken.  The alias will already have been
created by the time the code is executed.  To create an alias
conditionally, it would have to be embedded in an &quot;eval&quot; directive so
that it is compiled at runtime.</li>

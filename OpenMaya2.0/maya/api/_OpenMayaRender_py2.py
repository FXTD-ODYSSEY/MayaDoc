        This method only affects items explicitly created by the plug-in.
        
        If the surface shader node is None or supported by neither Maya nor the plug-in, this method will clear the shader assignment on the render item, which will thus not be drawn.
        
        The shape path is used as the object context for shading network evaluation to ensure that the shader instance fits its requirements. If the shape path is invalid (e.g. an empty path), a shader instance to fit basic requirements is created but will not include any geometry-dependent requirements.
        
        The linkLostCb will be invoked whenever the link to the surface shader node is lost. The link can be lost in a number of ways, e.g. shader nodes are deleted or shading network connections are modified. However, the linkLostCb won't be invoked for a change to shading group level connection; if needed, it is the DG node's responsibility to monitor any changes to shading group level connection by MPxNode::connectionMade and MPxNode::connectionBroken.
        
        There is no guarantee that the surface shader node is still valid after the link is lost. The linkLostCb should check the validity and assign the render item with a shader instance appropriately.
        
        After the shader instance is set, its parameter values can be automatically updated by Viewport 2.0 whenever the related shading attributes changed, therefore access to the shader instance is not provided in order to avoid unexpected behavior.

        Get the shader instance by evaluating the shading network of a surface shader node (either standard or custom) in the scene.
        
        If the surface shader node is NULL or supported by neither Maya nor the plug-in, this method will return NULL.
        
        The shape path is used as the object context for shading network evaluation to ensure that the shader instance fits its requirements. If the shape path is invalid (e.g. an empty path), a shader instance to fit basic requirements is created but will not include any geometry-dependent requirements.
        
        The linkLostCb will be invoked whenever the link to the surface shader node is lost. The link can be lost in a number of ways, e.g. shader nodes are deleted or shading network connections are modified. However, the linkLostCb will not be invoked for changes to a shading group; if needed, it is the plug-in's responsibility to monitor any changes to the shading group (via MNodeMessage and/or MPxNode::connectionMade/connectionBroken).

              contain data, but attributes of complex types (arrays, meshes, etc) may contain no data if none has ever been assigned
              to them. When this happens the command will return with no result: not an empty string, but no result at all. Attempting
              to directly compare this non-result to another value or use it in an expression will result in an error, but you can
              assign it to a variable in which case the variable will be set to the default value for its type (e.g. an empty string
              for a string variable, zero for an integer variable, an empty array for an array variable). So to be safe when using
              this flag, always assign its result to a string variable, never try to use it directly.                   Flag can have
              multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        Maya Bug Fix:
          - setAttr did not work with type matrix.
        
        Modifications:
          - No need to set type, this will automatically be determined
          - Adds support for passing a list or tuple as the second argument for datatypes such as double3.
          - When setting stringArray datatype, you no longer need to prefix the list with the number of elements - just pass a list or tuple as with other arrays
          - Added 'force' kwarg, which causes the attribute to be added if it does not exist.
                - if no type flag is passed, the attribute type is based on type of value being set (if you want a float, be sure to format it as a float, e.g.  3.0 not 3)
                - currently does not support compound attributes
                - currently supported python-to-maya mappings:

          - Added ability to set enum attributes using the string values; this may be
            done either by setting the 'asString' kwarg to True, or simply supplying
            a string value for an enum attribute.
        
        Flags:
          - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
              The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if the attribute has an incoming
              connection). This flag is only used during file I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
              overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
        
          - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
              Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be defined as caching. Only those attributes
              that are not defined by default to be cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
              caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
        
          - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
              Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag cannot provide enough information. This flag
              is optional and is primarily intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this flag, and the
              interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face -
              hints the total number of elements in the face edge lists
        
          - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
              Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are always display in the channelBox
              regardless of the channelBox settting.
        
          - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
              For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute, clamp it to the min or max instead of
              failing
        
          - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
              Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
        
          - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
              Sets the attribute's lock state on or off.
        
          - size : s                       (int)           [create]

          - attribute : at                 (unicode)       [create]
              Attribute name to set keyframes on.

          - identity : id                  (bool)          [create]
              Sets an identity key on an animation layer.  An identity key is one that nullifies the effect of the anim layer.  This
              flag has effect only when the attribute being keyed is being driven by animation layers.
        
          - inTangentType : itt            (unicode)       [create]
              The in tangent type for keyframes set by this command. Valid values are: auto, clamped, fast, flat, linear, plateau,

              Insert keys at the given time(s) and preserve the shape of the animation curve(s). Note: the tangent type on inserted
              keys will be fixed so that the curve shape can be preserved.
        
          - insertBlend : ib               (bool)          [create]
              If true, a pairBlend node will be inserted for channels that have nodes other than animCurves driving them, so that such
              channels can have blended animation. If false, these channels will not have keys inserted. If the flag is not specified,
              the blend will be inserted based on the global preference for blending animation.
        
          - minimizeRotation : mr          (bool)          [create]
              For rotations, ensures that the key that is set is a minimum distance away from the previous key.  Default is false
        
          - noResolve : nr                 (bool)          [create]
              When used with the -value flag, causes the specified value to be set directly onto the animation curve, without
              attempting to resolve the value across animation layers.
        
          - outTangentType : ott           (unicode)       [create]

          - respectKeyable : rk            (bool)          [create]
              When used with the -attribute flag, prevents the keying of the non keyable attributes.
        
          - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
              Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except controlPoints.  Default: true
        
          - time : t                       (time)          [create]
              Time at which to set a keyframe on time-based animation curves.
        
          - useCurrentLockedWeights : lw   (bool)          [create]
              If we are setting a key over an existing key, use that key tangent's locked weight value for the new locked weight
              value.  Default is false
        
          - value : v                      (float)         [create]
              Value at which to set the keyframe. Using the value flag will not cause the keyed attribute to change to the specified
              value until the scene re-evaluates. Therefore, if you want the attribute to update to the new value immediately, use the
              setAttr command in addition to setting the key.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a

      - prefix : pre                   (unicode)       [create]
          The string argument is the name of a Maya command taking one string argument. This command is called each time data is
          sent to the command port. The data written to the command port is passed as the argument to the prefix command. The data
          from the command port is encoded as with enocodeString and enclosed in quotes.  If newline characters are embedded in
          the command port data, the input is split into individual lines. These lines are treated as if they were separate writes
          to the command port. Only the result to the last prefix command is returned.
    
      - returnNumCommands : rnc        (bool)          [create]
          Ignore the result of the command, but return the number of commands that have been read and executed in this call. This
          is a simple way to track buffer overflow. This flag is ignored when the noreturnflag is specified.

          Enables security warning on command port input.
    
      - sourceType : stp               (unicode)       [create]
          The string argument is used to indicate which source type would be passed to the commandPort, like mel, python. The
          default source type is mel.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    Modifications:
      - returns a list of PyNode objects for flags: (query and (nodeList or connectionList))
      - returns a PyNode object for flags: (query and (findContainer or asset))
      - <lambda>(result) for flags: (query and bindAttr and not (publishName or publishAsParent or publishAsChild))
      - f(result) for flags: (query and unbindAttr and not (publishName or publishAsParent or publishAsChild))
    
    Flags:
      - addNode : an                   (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [create,edit]
          Specifies the list of nodes to add to container.
    
      - asset : a                      (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [query]
          When queried, if all the nodes in nodeList belong to the same container, returns container's name. Otherwise returns
          empty string. This flag is functionally equivalent to the findContainer flag.
    
      - assetMember : am               (unicode)       [query]
          Can be used during query in conjunction with the bindAttr flag to query for the only published attributes related to the
          specified node within the container.
    
      - bindAttr : ba                  (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
          Bind a contained attribute to an unbound published name on the interface of the container; returns a list of bound
          published names. The first string specifies the node and attribute name to be bound in node.attrformat. The second
          string specifies the name of the unbound published name. In query mode, returns a string array of the published names
          and their corresponding attributes. The flag can also be used in query mode in conjunction with the -publishName,
          -publishAsParent, and -publishAsChild flags.
    
      - connectionList : cl            (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of the exterior connections to the container node.
    
      - current : c                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          In create mode, specify that the newly created asset should be current. In edit mode, set the selected asset as current.
          In query, return the current asset.
    
      - fileName : fn                  (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [query]
          Used to query for the assets associated with a given file name.
    
      - findContainer : fc             (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [query]
          When queried, if all the nodes in nodeList belong to the same container, returns container's name. Otherwise returns
          empty string.
    
      - force : f                      (bool)          [create,edit]
          This flag can be used in conjunction with -addNode and -removeNode flags only. If specified with -addNode, nodes will be
          disconnected from their current containers before they are added to new one. If specified with -removeNode, nodes will
          be removed from all containers, instead of remaining in the parent container if being removed from a nested container.
    
      - includeHierarchyAbove : iha    (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that the parent hierarchy of the supplied node list should also be included in the container (or deleted
          from the container). Hierarchy inclusion will stop at nodes which are members of other containers.
    
      - includeHierarchyBelow : ihb    (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that the hierarchy below the supplied node list should also be included in the container (or delete from
          the container). Hierarchy inclusion will stop at nodes which are members of other containers.
    
      - includeNetwork : inc           (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that the node network connected to supplied node list should also be included in the container. Network
          traversal will stop at default nodes and nodes which are members of other containers.
    
      - includeNetworkDetails : ind    (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Used to specify specific parts of the network that should be included. Valid arguments to this flag are: channels, sdk,
          constraints, historyand expressions, inputs, outputs. The difference between this flag and the includeNetwork flag, is
          that it will include all connected nodes regardless of their type. Note that dag containers include their children, so
          they will always include constraint nodes that are parented beneath the selected objects, even when constraints are not
          specified as an input.
    
      - includeShaders : isd           (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that for any shapes included, their shaders will also be included in the container.
    
      - includeShapes : ish            (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that for any transforms selected, their direct child shapes will be included in the container (or
          deleted from the container). This flag is not necessary when includeHierarchyBelow is used since the child shapes and
          all other descendents will automatically be included.
    
      - includeTransform : it          (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used to specify that for any shapes selected, their parent transform will be included in the container (or deleted from
          the container). This flag is not necessary when includeHierarchyAbove is used since the parent transform and all of its
          parents will automatically be included.
    
      - isContainer : isc              (bool)          [query]
          Return true if the selected or specified node is a container node. If multiple containers are queried, only the state of
          the first will be returned.
    
      - name : n                       (unicode)       [create]
          Sets the name of the newly-created container.
    
      - nodeList : nl                  (bool)          [query]
          When queried, returns a list of nodes in container. The list will be sorted in the order they were added to the
          container. This will also display any reordering done with the reorderContainer command.
    
      - nodeNamePrefix : nnp           (bool)          [create,edit]
          Specifies that the name of published attributes should be of the form node_attr. Must be used with the
          -publishConnections/-pc flag.
    
      - parentContainer : par          (bool)          [query]
          Flag to query the parent container of a specified container.
    
      - preview : p                    (bool)          [create]
          This flag is valid in create mode only. It indicates that you do not want the container to be created, instead you want
          to preview its contents. When this flag is used, Maya will select the nodes that would be put in the container if you
          did create the container. For example you can see what would go into the container with -includeNetwork, then modify
          your selection as desired, and do a create container with the selected objects only.
    
      - publishAndBind : pb            (unicode, unicode) [edit]
          Publish the given name and bind the attribute to the given name. First string specifies the node and attribute name in
          node.attrformat. Second string specifies the name it should be published with.
    
      - publishAsChild : pac           (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
          Publish contained node to the interface of the container to indicate it can be a child of external nodes. The second
          string is the name of the published node. In query mode, returns a string of the published names and the corresponding
          nodes. If -publishName flag is used in query mode, only returns the published names; if -bindAttr flag is used in query
          mode, only returns the name of the published nodes.
    
      - publishAsParent : pap          (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
          Publish contained node to the interface of the container to indicate it can be a parent to external nodes. The second
          string is the name of the published node. In query mode, returns a string of array of the published names and the
          corresponding nodes. If -publishName flag is used in query mode, only returns the published names; if -bindAttr flag is
          used in query mode, only returns the name of the published nodes.
    
      - publishAsRoot : pro            (unicode, bool) [query,edit]
          Publish or unpublish a node as a root. The significance of root transform node is twofold. When container-centric
          selection is enabled, the root transform will be selected if a container node in the hierarchy below it is selected in
          the main scene view. Also, when exporting a container proxy, any published root transformation attributes such as
          translate, rotate or scale will be hooked up to attributes on a stand-in node. In query mode, returns the node that has
          been published as root.
    
      - publishAttr : pa               (unicode)       [query]
          In query mode, can only be used with the -publishName(-pn) flag, and takes an attribute as an argument; returns the
          published name of the attribute, if any.
    
      - publishConnections : pc        (bool)          [create,edit]
          Publish all connections from nodes inside the container to nodes outside the container.
    
      - publishName : pn               (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Publish a name to the interface of the container, and returns the actual name published to the interface.  In query
          mode, returns the published names for the container. If the -bindAttr flag is specified, returns only the names that are
          bound; if the -unbindAttr flag is specified, returns only the names that are not bound; if the
          -publishAsParent/-publishAsChild flags are specified, returns only names of published parents/children. if the
          -publishAttr is specified with an attribute argument in the node.attrformat, returns the published name for that
          attribute, if any.
    
      - removeContainer : rc           (bool)          [edit]
          Disconnects all the nodes from container and deletes container node.
    
      - removeNode : rn                (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [edit]
          Specifies the list of nodes to remove from container. If node is a member of a nested container, it will be added to the
          parent container. To remove from all containers completely, use the -force flag.
    
      - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          By default, a container node will be created. Alternatively, the type flag can be used to indicate that a different type
          of container should be created. At the present time, the only other valid type of container node is dagContainer.
    
      - unbindAndUnpublish : ubp       (unicode)       [edit]
          Unbind the given attribute (in node.attrformat) and unpublish its associated name. Unbinding a compound may trigger
          unbinds of its compound parents/children. So the advantage of using this one flag is that it will automatically
          unpublish the names associated with these automatic unbinds.
    
      - unbindAttr : ua                (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]
          Unbind a published attribute from its published name on the interface of the container, leaving an unbound published
          name on the interface of the container; returns a list of unbound published names. The first string specifies the node
          and attribute name to be unbound in node.attrformat, and the second string specifies the name of the bound published
          name. In query mode, can only be used with the -publishName, -publishAsParent and -publishAsChild flags.
    
      - unbindChild : unc              (unicode)       [edit]
          Unbind the node published as child, but do not remove its published name from the interface of the container.
    
      - unbindParent : unp             (unicode)       [edit]
          Unbind the node published as parent, but do not remove its published name from the interface of the container.
    
      - unpublishChild : upc           (unicode)       [edit]
          Unpublish node published as child from the interface of the container
    
      - unpublishName : un             (unicode)       [edit]
          Unpublish an unbound name from the interface of the container.
    
      - unpublishParent : upp          (unicode)       [edit]
          Unpublish node published as parent from the interface of the container
    
      - unsortedOrder : uso            (bool)          [query]
          This flag has no effect on the operation of the container command (OBSOLETE).                  Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    involved in a cycle.  If the -list flag is used then the return value is the list of all plugs in cycles (involving the
    selected plug or node if any). Note that it is possible for evaluation cycles to occur even where no DG connections
    exist. Here are some examples: 1) Nodes with evaluation-time dependent connections: An example is expression nodes,
    because we cannot tell what an expression node is actually referring to until it is evaluated, and such evaluation-time
    dependent nodes may behave differently based on the context (e.g. time) they are evaluated at. If you suspect a cycle
    due to such a connection, the best way to detect the cycle is through manual inspection. 2) Cycles due to DAG hierarchy:
    noting that DAG nodes are implicitely connected through parenting, if a child DAG node connects an output into the input
    of a parent node, a cycle will exist if the plugs involved also affect each other. In order to enable detection of
    cycles involving the DAG, add the -dag flag to the command line. Note also that this command may incorrectly report a
    cycle on an instanced skeleton where some of the instances use IK. You will have to examine the reported cycle yourself
    to determine if it is truly a cycle or not. The evaluation time cycle checking will not report false cycles.

def sets(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command is used to create a set, query some state of a set, or perform operations to update the membership of a
    set. A set is a logical grouping of an arbitrary collection of objects, attributes, or components of objects. Sets are
    dependency nodes. Connections from objects to a set define membership in the set. Sets are used throughout Maya in a
    multitude of ways. They are used to define an association of material properties to objects, to define an association of
    lights to objects, to define a bookmark or named collection of objects, to define a character, and to define the
    components to be deformed by some deformation operation. Sets can be connected to any number of partitions. A partition
    is a node which enforces mutual exclusivity amoung the sets in the partition. That is, if an object is in a set which is
    in a partition, that object cannot be a member of any other set that is in the partition. Without any flags, the
    setscommand will create a set with a default name of set#(where # is an integer). If no items are specified on the
    command line, the currently selected items are added to the set. The -em/empty flag can be used to create an empty set
    and not have the selected items added to the set. Sets can be created to have certain restrictions on membership. There
    can be renderablesets which only allow renderable objects (such as nurbs geometry or polymesh faces) to be members of
    the set. There can also be vertex (or control point), edit point, edge, or face sets which only allow those types of
    components to be members of a set. Note that for these sets, if an object with a valid type of component is to be added
    to a set, the components of the object are added to the set instead. Sets can have an associated color which is only of
    use when creating vertex sets. The color can be one of the eight user defined colors defined in the color preferences.
    This color can be used, for example to distinguish which vertices are being deformed by a particular deformation.
    Objects, components, or attributes can be added to a set using one of three flags. The -add/addElement flag will add the
    objects to a set as long as this won't break any mutual exclusivity constraints. If there are any items which can't be
    added, the command will fail. The -in/include flag will only add those items which can be added and warn of those which
    can't. The -fe/forceElement flag will add all the items to the set but will also remove any of those items that are in
    any other set which is in the same partition as the set. There are several operations on sets that can be performed with
    the setscommand. Membership can be queried. Tests for whether an item is in a set or whether two sets share the same
    item can be performed. Also, the union, intersection and difference of sets can be performed which returns a list of
    members of the sets which are a result of the operation.

          Default state is false. This flag is valid in edit mode only. This flag is for use on sets that are acted on by
          deformers such as sculpt, lattice, blendShape. The default edit mode is to edit the membership of the group acted on by

          An operation that flattens the structure of the given set. That is, any sets contained by the given set will be replaced
          by its members so that the set no longer contains other sets but contains the other sets' members.
    
      - forceElement : fe              (PyNode)        [edit]
          For use in edit mode only. Forces addition of the items to the set. If the items are in another set which is in the same
          partition as the given set, the items will be removed from the other set in order to keep the sets in the partition
          mutually exclusive with respect to membership.
    
      - include : include              (PyNode)        [edit]

      - intersection : int             (PyNode)        [create]
          An operation that returns a list of items which are members of all the sets in the list.
    
      - isIntersecting : ii            (PyNode)        [create]

          Assigns string as the name for a new set. This flag is only valid for operations that create a new set.
    
      - noSurfaceShader : nss          (bool)          [create]
          If set is renderable, do not connect it to the default surface shader.  Flag has no meaning or effect for non renderable
          sets. This flag is for use in creation mode only. The default value is false.
    
      - noWarnings : nw                (bool)          [create]
          Indicates that warning messages should not be reported such as when trying to add an invalid item to a set. (used by UI)
    
      - nodesOnly : no                 (bool)          [query]
          This flag is usable with the -q/query flag but is ignored if used with another queryable flags. This flag modifies the
          results of the set membership query such that when there are attributes (e.g. sphere1.tx) or components of nodes
          included in the set, only the nodes will be listed. Each node will only be listed once, even if more than one attribute
          or component of the node exists in the set.
    
      - remove : rm                    (PyNode)        [edit]
          Removes the list of items from the given set.
    
      - renderable : r                 (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag indicates that a special type of set should be created. This type of set (shadingEngine as opposed to
          objectSet) has certain restrictions on its membership in that it can only contain renderable elements such as lights and
          geometry. These sets are referred to as shading groups and are automatically connected to the renderPartitionnode when
          created (to ensure mutual exclusivity of the set's members with the other sets in the partition). This flag is for use
          in creation or query mode only. The default value is false which means a normal set is created.
    
      - size : s                       (bool)          [query]
          Use the size flag to query the length of the set.

          Produces a new set with the list of items and removes each item in the list of items from the given set.
    
      - subtract : sub                 (PyNode)        [create]
          An operation between two sets which returns the members of the first set that are not in the second set.
    
      - text : t                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          joint. The connection of inverseScale will occur if both child and parent are joints and no connection is present on
          child's inverseScale. In case of a reparenting, the old inverseScale will only get broken if the old parent is a joint.
          Otherwise connection will remain intact. This flag suppresses this behaviour.
    
      - relative : r                   (bool)          [create]
          preserve existing local object transformations (relative to the parent node)
    
      - removeObject : rm              (bool)          [create]
          Remove the immediate parent of every object specified. To remove only a single instance of a shape from a parent, the
          path to the shape should be specified. Note: if there is a single parent then the object is effectively deleted from the
          scene. Use -world to remove the world as a parent of the given object.
    
      - shape : s                      (bool)          [create]
          The parent command usually only operates on transforms.  Using this flags allows a shape that is specified to be
          directly parented under the given transform.  This is used to instance a shape node. (ie. parent -add -shapeis
          equivalent to the instancecommand). This flag is primarily used by the file format.
    
      - world : w                      (bool)          [create]
          unparent given object(s) (parent to world)                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple

def move(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The move command is used to change the positions of geometric objects. The default behaviour, when no objects or flags
    are passed, is to do a absolute move on each currently selected object in the world space. The value of the coordinates
    are interpreted as being defined in the current linear unit unless the unit is explicitly mentioned. When using
    -objectSpace there are two ways to use this command. If numbers are typed without units then the internal values of the
    object are set to these values. If, on the other hand a unit is specified then the internal value is set to the
    equivalent internal value that represents that world-space distance. The -localSpace flag moves the object in its parent
    space. In this space the x,y,z values correspond directly to the tx, ty, tz channels on the object. The
    -rotatePivotRelative/-scalePivotRelative flags can be used with the -absolute flag to translate an object so that its
    pivot point ends up at the given absolute position. These flags will be ignored if components are specified. The
    -worldSpaceDistance flag is a modifier flag that may be used in conjunction with the -objectSpace/-localSpace flags.
    When this flag is specified the command treats the x,y,z values as world space units so the object will move the
    specified world space distance but it will move along the axis specified by the -objectSpace/-localSpace flag. The
    default behaviour, without this flag, is to treat the x,y,z values as units in object space or local space. In other
    words, the worldspace distance moved will depend on the transformations applied to the object unless this flag is
    specified.

      - allows any iterable object to be passed as first argument::

    The lscommand returns the names (and optionally the type names) of objects in the scene. The most common use of lsis to

    in the scene but it can also be used to filter or list the selected objects when used in conjunction with the -selection

    will be pairs of object, typevalues. Internal nodes (for example itemFilter nodes) are typically filtered so that only
    scene objects are returned. However, using a wildcard will cause all the nodes matching the wild card to show up,
    including internal nodes.  For example, ls \*will list all nodes whether internal or not. When Maya is in relativeNames
    mode, the lscommand will return names relativeto the current namespace and ls \*will list from the the current

          When set to true, this command will look for name matches in all namespaces. When set to false, this command will only
          look for matches in namespaces that are requested (e.g. by specifying a name containing the ':'... ns1:pSphere1).
    
      - referencedNodes : rn           (bool)          [create]

          This flag specifies the maximum number of elements to be returned from the end of the list of items. Note: each    type
          flag will return at most this many items so if multiple type flags are specified then the number of items returned can
          be greater than this amount

          List all objects of the specified type. This flag can appear multiple times on the command line. Note: the type passed
          to this flag is the same type name returned from the showType flag. Note: some selection items in Maya do not have a
          specific object/data type associated with them and will return untypedwhen listed with this flag. This flag cannot be
          used in conjunction with the exactType or excludeType flag.
    
      - undeletable : ud               (bool)          [create]
          Returns nodes that cannot be deleted (which includes locked nodes). These nodes also cannot be renamed.

          Return node UUIDs instead of names. Note that there are no UUID paths- combining this flag with e.g. the -long flag will
          not result in a path formed of node UUIDs.

    This command is used to put objects onto or off of the active list. If none of the five flags [-add, -af, -r, -d, -tgl]
    are specified, the default is to replace the objects on the active list with the given list of objects. When selecting a
    set as in select set1, the behaviour is for all the members of the set to become selected instead of the set itself. If
    you want to select a set, the -ne/noExpandflag must be used. With the advent of namespaces, selection by name may be
    confusing.  To clarify, without a qualified namespace, name lookup is limited to objects in the root namespace :. There
    are really two parts of a name: the namespace and the name itself which is unique within the namespace. If you want to
    select objects in a specific namespace, you need to include the namespace separator :. For example, 'select -r foo\*' is
    trying to look for an object with the fooprefix in the root namespace. It is not trying to look for all objects in the
    namespace with the fooprefix. If you want to select all objects in a namespace (foo), use 'select foo:\*'. Note: When
    the application starts up, there are several dependency nodes created by the system which must exist. These objects are
    not deletable but are selectable.  All objects (dag and dependency nodes) in the scene can be obtained using the
    lscommand without any arguments. When using the -all, adn/allDependencyNodesor -ado/allDagObjectsflags, only the
    deletable objects are selected.  The non deletable object can still be selected by explicitly specifying their name as
    in select time1;.
    
    Modifications:

def addAttr(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command is used to add a dynamic attribute to a node or nodes. Either the longName or the shortName or both must be
    specified. If neither a dataType nor an attributeType is specified, a double attribute will be added.  The dataType flag
    can be specified more than once indicating that any of the supplied types will be accepted (logical-or).  To add a non-
    double attribute the following criteria can be used to determine whether the dataType or the attributeType flag is
    appropriate.  Some types, such as double3can use either. In these cases the -dtflag should be used when you only wish to
    access the data as an atomic entity (eg. you never want to access the three individual values that make up a double3).
    In general it is best to use the -atin these cases for maximum flexibility. In most cases the -dtversion will not
    display in the attribute editor as it is an atomic type and you are not allowed to change individual parts of it.  All
    attributes flagged as (compound)below or the compound attribute itself are not actually added to the node until all of
    the children are defined (using the -pflag to set their parent to the compound being created).  See the EXAMPLES section

    Modifications:

                Vector      double3
      - when querying dataType, the dataType is no longer returned as a list
      - when editing hasMinValue, hasMaxValue, hasSoftMinValue, or hasSoftMaxValue the passed boolean value was ignored
        and the command instead behaved as a toggle.  The behavior is now more intuitive::
    
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='test', at='double', k=1)
            >>> addAttr('persp.test', query=1, hasMaxValue=True)
            False
            >>> addAttr('persp.test', edit=1, hasMaxValue=False)
            >>> addAttr('persp.test', query=1, hasMaxValue=True)
            False
            >>> addAttr('persp.test', edit=1, hasMaxValue=True)
            >>> addAttr('persp.test', query=1, hasMaxValue=True)
            True
    
      - allow passing a list or dict instead of a string for enumName
      - allow user to pass in type and determine whether it is a dataType or
        attributeType. Types that may be both, such as float2, float3, double2,
        double3, long2, long3, short2, and short3 are all treated as
        attributeTypes. In addition, as a convenience, since these attributeTypes
        are actually treated as compound attributes, the child attributes are
        automatically created, with X/Y/Z appended, unless usedAsColor is set, in
        which case R/G/B is added. Alternatively, the suffices can explicitly
        specified with childSuffixes:
    
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoDouble', type='double', k=1)
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoDouble', query=1, attributeType=1)
            u'double'
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoDouble', query=1, dataType=1)
            u'TdataNumeric'
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoMesh', type='mesh', k=1)
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoMesh', query=1, attributeType=1)
            u'typed'
            >>> addAttr('persp.autoMesh', query=1, dataType=1)
            u'mesh'
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoDouble3Vec', type='double3', k=1)
            >>> [x.attrName() for x in PyNode('persp').listAttr() if 'autoDouble3' in x.name()]
            [u'autoDouble3Vec', u'autoDouble3VecX', u'autoDouble3VecY', u'autoDouble3VecZ']
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoFloat3Col', type='float3', usedAsColor=1)
            >>> [x.attrName() for x in PyNode('persp').listAttr() if 'autoFloat3' in x.name()]
            [u'autoFloat3Col', u'autoFloat3ColR', u'autoFloat3ColG', u'autoFloat3ColB']
            >>> addAttr('persp', ln='autoLong2', type='long2', childSuffixes=['_first', '_second'])
            >>> [x.attrName() for x in PyNode('persp').listAttr() if 'autoLong2' in x.name()]

    Flags:
      - attributeType : at             (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the attribute type, see above table for more details. Note that the attribute types float, matrixand stringare
          also MEL keywords and must be enclosed in quotes.
    
      - binaryTag : bt                 (unicode)       [create,query]
          This flag is obsolete and does not do anything any more
    
      - cachedInternally : ci          (bool)          [create,query]
          Whether or not attribute data is cached internally in the node. This flag defaults to true for writable attributes and
          false for non-writable attributes. A warning will be issued if users attempt to force a writable attribute to be
          uncached as this will make it impossible to set keyframes.
    
      - category : ct                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          An attribute category is a string associated with the attribute to identify it. (e.g. the name of a plugin that created
          the attribute, version information, etc.) Any attribute can be associated with an arbitrary number of categories however
          categories can not be removed once associated.
    
      - dataType : dt                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the data type.  See setAttrfor more information on data type names.
    
      - defaultValue : dv              (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the default value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - disconnectBehaviour : dcb      (int)           [create,query]
          defines the Disconnect Behaviour 2 Nothing, 1 Reset, 0 Delete
    
      - enumName : en                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Flag used to specify the ui names corresponding to the enum values. The specified string should contain a colon-
          separated list of the names, with optional values. If values are not specified, they will treated as sequential integers
          starting with 0. For example: -enumName A:B:Cwould produce options: A,B,C with values of 0,1,2; -enumName
          zero:one:two:thousand=1000would produce four options with values 0,1,2,1000; and -enumName
          solo=1:triplet=3:quintet=5would produce three options with values 1,3,5.  (Note that there is a current limitation of
          the Channel Box that will sometimes incorrectly display an enumerated attribute's pull-down menu.  Extra menu items can
          appear that represent the numbers inbetween non-sequential option values.  To avoid this limitation, specify sequential
          values for the options of any enumerated attributes that will appear in the Channel Box.  For example:
          solo=1:triplet=2:quintet=3.)
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create,query]
          Returns true if the attribute queried is a user-added, dynamic attribute; false if not.
    
      - fromPlugin : fp                (bool)          [create,query]
          Was the attribute originally created by a plugin? Normally set automatically when the API call is made - only added here
          to support storing it in a file independently from the creating plugin.
    
      - hasMaxValue : hxv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a maximum value. (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - hasMinValue : hnv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a minimum value. (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - hasSoftMaxValue : hsx          (bool)          [create,query]
          Flag indicating whether a numeric attribute has a soft maximum.
    
      - hasSoftMinValue : hsn          (bool)          [create,query]
          Flag indicating whether a numeric attribute has a soft minimum.
    
      - hidden : h                     (bool)          [create,query]
          Will this attribute be hidden from the UI?
    
      - indexMatters : im              (bool)          [create,query]
          Sets whether an index must be used when connecting to this multi-attribute. Setting indexMatters to false forces the
          attribute to non-readable.
    
      - internalSet : internalSet      (bool)          [create,query]
          Whether or not the internal cached value is set when this attribute value is changed.  This is an internal flag used for
          updating UI elements.
    
      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create,query]
          Is the attribute keyable by default?
    
      - longName : ln                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Sets the long name of the attribute.
    
      - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the maximum value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - minValue : min                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the minimum value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - multi : m                      (bool)          [create,query]
          Makes the new attribute a multi-attribute.
    
      - niceName : nn                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the nice name of the attribute for display in the UI.  Setting the attribute's nice name to a non-empty string
          overrides the default behaviour of looking up the nice name from Maya's string catalog.   (Use the MEL commands
          attributeNiceNameand attributeQuery -niceNameto lookup an attribute's nice name in the catalog.)
    
      - numberOfChildren : nc          (int)           [create,query]
          How many children will the new attribute have?
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          Attribute that is to be the new attribute's parent.
    
      - proxy : pxy                    (unicode)       [create,query]
          Proxy another node's attribute. Proxied plug will be connected as source. The UsedAsProxy flag is automatically set in
          this case.
    
      - readable : r                   (bool)          [create,query]
          Can outgoing connections be made from this attribute?
    
      - shortName : sn                 (unicode)       [create,query]
          Sets the short name of the attribute.
    
      - softMaxValue : smx             (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Soft maximum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default limit used in sliders for this attribute.
    
      - softMinValue : smn             (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Soft minimum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default limit used in sliders for this attribute.
    
      - storable : s                   (bool)          [create,query]
          Can the attribute be stored out to a file?
    
      - usedAsColor : uac              (bool)          [create,query]
          Is the attribute to be used as a color definition? Must have 3 DOUBLE or 3 FLOAT children to use this flag.  The
          attribute type -atshould be double3or float3as appropriate.  It can also be used to less effect with data types -dtas
          double3or float3as well but some parts of the code do not support this alternative.  The special attribute types/data
          spectrumand reflectancealso support the color flag and on them it is set by default.
    
      - usedAsFilename : uaf           (bool)          [create,query]
          Is the attribute to be treated as a filename definition? This flag is only supported on attributes with data type -dtof
          string.
    
      - usedAsProxy : uap              (bool)          [create,query]
          Set if the specified attribute should be treated as a proxy to another attributes.
    
      - writable : w                   (bool)          [create,query]
          Can incoming connections be made to this attribute?                                Flag can have multiple arguments,
          passed either as a tuple or a list.

def makeIdentity(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The makeIdentity command is a quick way to reset the selected transform and all of its children down to the shape level
    by the identity transformation.  You can also specify which of transform, rotate or scale is applied down from the
    selected transform. The identity transformation means: translate = 0, 0, 0rotate = 0, 0, 0scale = 1, 1, 1shear = 1, 1,
    1If a transform is a joint, then the translateattribute may not be 0, but will be used to position the joints so that
    they preserve their world space positions.  The translate flag doesn't apply to joints, since joints must preserve their
    world space positions.  Only the rotate and scale flags are meaningful when applied to joints. If the -a/apply flag is
    true, then the transforms that are reset are accumulated and applied to the all shapes below the modified transforms, so
    that the shapes will not move. The pivot positions are recalculated so that they also will not move in world space. If
    this flag is false, then the transformations are reset to identity, without any changes to preserve position.
    
    Flags:
      - apply : a                      (bool)          [create]
          If this flag is true, the accumulated transforms are applied to the shape after the transforms are made identity, such
          that the world space positions of the transforms pivots are preserved, and the shapes do not move. The default is false.
    
      - jointOrient : jo               (bool)          [create]
          If this flag is set, the joint orient on joints will be reset to align with worldspace.
    
      - normal : n                     (int)           [create]
          If this flag is set to 1, the normals on polygonal objects will be frozen.  This flag is valid only when the -apply flag
          is on. If this flag is set to 2, the normals on polygonal objects will be frozen only if its a non-rigid transformation
          matrix. ie, a transformation that does not contain shear, skew or non-proportional scaling. The default behaviour is not
          to freeze normals.
    
      - preserveNormals : pn           (bool)          [create]
          If this flag is true, the normals on polygonal objects will be reversed if the objects are negatively scaled
          (reflection). This flag is valid only when the -apply flag is on.

          Name of the node type to which the attribute pattern is to be applied. This flag will cause a new extension attribute
          tree to be created, making the new attributes available on all nodes of the given type. If it is not specified then
          either a node name must be specified or a node must be selected for application of dynamic attributes.
    
      - patternName : pn               (unicode)       [create]
          The name of the pattern to apply. The pattern with this name must have been previously created using the
          createAttrPatterns command.                               Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or

    Maya Bug Fix:
      - setAttr did not work with type matrix.
    
    Modifications:
      - No need to set type, this will automatically be determined
      - Adds support for passing a list or tuple as the second argument for datatypes such as double3.
      - When setting stringArray datatype, you no longer need to prefix the list with the number of elements - just pass a list or tuple as with other arrays
      - Added 'force' kwarg, which causes the attribute to be added if it does not exist.
            - if no type flag is passed, the attribute type is based on type of value being set (if you want a float, be sure to format it as a float, e.g.  3.0 not 3)
            - currently does not support compound attributes
            - currently supported python-to-maya mappings:

      - Added ability to set enum attributes using the string values; this may be
        done either by setting the 'asString' kwarg to True, or simply supplying
        a string value for an enum attribute.
    
    Flags:
      - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
          The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if the attribute has an incoming
          connection). This flag is only used during file I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
          overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
    
      - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
          Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be defined as caching. Only those attributes
          that are not defined by default to be cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
          caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
    
      - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
          Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag cannot provide enough information. This flag
          is optional and is primarily intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this flag, and the
          interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face -
          hints the total number of elements in the face edge lists
    
      - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
          Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are always display in the channelBox
          regardless of the channelBox settting.
    
      - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
          For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute, clamp it to the min or max instead of
          failing
    
      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
          Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
    
      - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
          Sets the attribute's lock state on or off.
    
      - size : s                       (int)           [create]
          Defines the size of a multi-attribute array. This is only a hint, used to help allocate memory as efficiently as
          possible.
    
      - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create]
          Identifies the type of data.  If the -type flag is not present, a numeric type is assumed.                  Flag can
          have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    This command allows you to change the units in which you will work in Maya. There are three types of units: linear,

    in Y, 3cm in Z, and as creating a sphere with radius 4cm. Similarly, if the current time unit is Film (24 frames per
    second), then the command: currentTime 6; will be interpreted as setting the current time to frame 6 in the Film unit,
    which is 6/24 or 0.25 seconds. You can always override the unit of a particular numeric value to a command be specifying
    it one the command. For example, using the above examples: move 5m -2mm 3cm; sphere -radius 4inch; currentTime 6ntsc;
    would move the object 5 meters in X, -2 millimeters in Y, 3 centimeters in Z, create a sphere of radius 4 inches, and

          Query or edit the label of the representation that is the argument to this flag, for a given assembly.  In both query
          and edit modes, the -repLabel flag specifies the name of the representation.  In edit mode, the -newRepLabel flag must
          be used to specify the new representation label.
    
      - repName : rnm                  (unicode)       [edit]
          Specify the representation name to set on representation creation or rename. This flag is optional with the
          createRepresentation flag: if omitted, the assembly will name the representation.  It is mandatory with the
          renameRepresentation flag.
    
      - repNamespace : rns             (unicode)       [query]
          Query the representation namespace of this assembly node. The value returned is used by Maya for creating the namespace
          where nodes created by the activation of a representation will be added. If a name clash occurs when the namespace is
          added to its parent namespace, Maya will update repNamespace with the new name. Two namespaces are involved when dealing
          with an assembly node: the namespace of the assembly node itself (which this flag does not affect or query), and the
          namespace of its representations. The representation namespace is a child of its assembly node's namespace. The assembly
          node's namespace is set by its containing assembly, if it is nested, or by the top-level file. Either the assembly
          node's namespace, or the representation namespace, or both, can be the empty string. It should be noted that if the
          assembly node is nested, the assembly node's namespace will be (by virtue of its nesting) the representation namespace
          of its containing assembly.
    
      - repPostCreateUIProc : poc      (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Set or query the UI post-creation procedure for a specific representation type, and for a specific assembly type.  This
          procedure takes two arguments, the first the DAG path to the assembly, and the second the name of the representation.
          It returns no value.  It will be invoked by Maya immediately after a representation of the specified type is created
          from the UI, but not through scripting.  It can be used to invoke a dialog, to obtain and set initial parameters on a
          newly-created representation.  The representation type is the argument of this flag. The -proc flag must be used to
          specify the procedure name.  The assembly type will be the default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify an
          explicit assembly type.
    
      - repPreCreateUIProc : pec       (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Set or query the UI pre-creation procedure for a specific representation type, and for a specific assembly type.  This
          procedure takes no argument, and returns a string that is passed as an argument to the -input flag when Maya invokes the
          assembly command with the -createRepresentation flag. The representation pre-creation procedure is invoked by Maya
          immediately before creating a representation of the specified type from the UI, but not through scripting.  It can be
          used to invoke a dialog, to obtain the creation argument for a new representation.  The representation type is the
          argument of this flag.  The -proc flag must be used to specify the procedure name.  The assembly type will be the
          default type, unless the -type flag is used to specify an explicit assembly type.

    Flags:
      - attributeType : at             (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the attribute type, see above table for more details. Note that the attribute types float, matrixand stringare
          also MEL keywords and must be enclosed in quotes.
    
      - binaryTag : bt                 (unicode)       [create,query]
          This flag is obsolete and does not do anything any more
    
      - cachedInternally : ci          (bool)          [create,query]
          Whether or not attribute data is cached internally in the node. This flag defaults to true for writable attributes and
          false for non-writable attributes. A warning will be issued if users attempt to force a writable attribute to be
          uncached as this will make it impossible to set keyframes.
    
      - category : ct                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          An attribute category is a string associated with the attribute to identify it. (e.g. the name of a plugin that created
          the attribute, version information, etc.) Any attribute can be associated with an arbitrary number of categories however
          categories can not be removed once associated.
    
      - dataType : dt                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the data type.  See setAttrfor more information on data type names.
    
      - defaultValue : dv              (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the default value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - disconnectBehaviour : dcb      (int)           [create,query]
          defines the Disconnect Behaviour 2 Nothing, 1 Reset, 0 Delete
    
      - enumName : en                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Flag used to specify the ui names corresponding to the enum values. The specified string should contain a colon-
          separated list of the names, with optional values. If values are not specified, they will treated as sequential integers
          starting with 0. For example: -enumName A:B:Cwould produce options: A,B,C with values of 0,1,2; -enumName
          zero:one:two:thousand=1000would produce four options with values 0,1,2,1000; and -enumName
          solo=1:triplet=3:quintet=5would produce three options with values 1,3,5.  (Note that there is a current limitation of
          the Channel Box that will sometimes incorrectly display an enumerated attribute's pull-down menu.  Extra menu items can
          appear that represent the numbers inbetween non-sequential option values.  To avoid this limitation, specify sequential
          values for the options of any enumerated attributes that will appear in the Channel Box.  For example:
          solo=1:triplet=2:quintet=3.)

      - fromPlugin : fp                (bool)          [create,query]
          Was the attribute originally created by a plugin? Normally set automatically when the API call is made - only added here
          to support storing it in a file independently from the creating plugin.
    
      - hasMaxValue : hxv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a maximum value. (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - hasMinValue : hnv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a minimum value. (can only be used for numeric attributes).
    
      - hasSoftMaxValue : hsx          (bool)          [create,query]
          Flag indicating whether a numeric attribute has a soft maximum.

      - indexMatters : im              (bool)          [create,query]
          Sets whether an index must be used when connecting to this multi-attribute. Setting indexMatters to false forces the
          attribute to non-readable.
    
      - internalSet : internalSet      (bool)          [create,query]
          Whether or not the internal cached value is set when this attribute value is changed.  This is an internal flag used for
          updating UI elements.
    
      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create,query]

      - niceName : nn                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the nice name of the attribute for display in the UI.  Setting the attribute's nice name to a non-empty string
          overrides the default behaviour of looking up the nice name from Maya's string catalog.   (Use the MEL commands
          attributeNiceNameand attributeQuery -niceNameto lookup an attribute's nice name in the catalog.)
    
      - nodeType : nt                  (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Specifies the type of node to which the attribute will be added. See the nodeType command for the names of different

          Sets the short name of the attribute.
    
      - softMaxValue : smx             (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Soft maximum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default limit used in sliders for this attribute.
    
      - softMinValue : smn             (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Soft minimum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default limit used in sliders for this attribute.

      - usedAsColor : uac              (bool)          [create,query]
          Is the attribute to be used as a color definition? Must have 3 DOUBLE or 3 FLOAT children to use this flag.  The
          attribute type -atshould be double3or float3as appropriate.  It can also be used to less effect with data types -dtas
          double3or float3as well but some parts of the code do not support this alternative.  The special attribute types/data
          spectrumand reflectancealso support the color flag and on them it is set by default.
    
      - usedAsFilename : uaf           (bool)          [create,query]
          Is the attribute to be treated as a filename definition? This flag is only supported on attributes with data type -dtof
          string.
    
      - usedAsProxy : uap              (bool)          [create,query]
          Set if the specified attribute should be treated as a proxy to another attributes.

    A container template is a description of a container's published interface. This command provides the ability to create
    and save a template file for a container or load an existing template file.  Once a template exists, the user can query
    the template information.                In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:
      - addBindingSet : abs            (unicode)       [create,edit]
          This argument is used to add a new binding set with the given name to a template. A default binding set will be created.
          If the binding set already exists, the force flag must be used to replace the existing binding set. When used with the
          fromContainer option, default bindings will be entered based on the current bindings of the designated container. When
          used without a reference container, the binding set will be made with placeholder entries. The template must be saved
          before the new binding set is permanently stored with the template file.
    
      - addNames : an                  (bool)          [edit]
          In edit mode, when used with the fromContainer flag, any published name on the container not present as an attribute on
          the template will be added to the template.
    
      - addView : av                   (unicode)       [create,edit]
          This argument is used to add a new view with the given name to a template. By default a view containing a flat list of
          all template attributes will be created.  The layoutMode flag provides more layout options. The template must be saved
          before the new view is permanently stored with the template file.
    
      - allKeyable : ak                (bool)          [create,edit]
          Used when the fromSelection flag is true and fromContainer is false. If true we will use all keyable attributes to
          define the template or the view, if false we use the attributes passed in with the attribute flag.
    
      - attribute : at                 (unicode)       [create,edit]
          If fromSelection is true and allKeyable is false, this attribute name will be used to create an attribute item in the
          template file.
    
      - attributeList : al             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Used in query mode, returns a list of attributes contained in the template definition.
    
      - baseName : bn                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Used in query mode, returns the base name of the template. The basename is the template name with any package qualifiers
          stripped off.
    
      - bindingSetList : bsl           (unicode)       [create,query]
          Used in query mode, returns a list of all binding sets defined on the template.
    
      - childAnchor : can              (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag can be optionally specified when querying the publishedNodeList. The resulting list will contain only
          childAnchor published nodes.
    
      - delete : d                     (bool)          [create]
          Delete the specified template and its file. All objects that are associated with this template or contained in the same
          template file will be deleted. To simply unload a template without permanently deleting its file, use unload instead.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [query]
          Returns true or false depending upon whether the specified template exists. When used with the matchFile argument, the
          query will return true if the template exists and the filename it was loaded from matches the filename given.
    
      - expandCompounds : ec           (bool)          [create,edit]
          This argument is used to determine how compound parent attributes and their children will be added to generated views
          when both are published to the container. When true, the compound parent and all compound child attributes published to
          the container will be included in the view. When false, only the parent attribute is included in the view. Note: if only
          the child attributes are published and not the parent, the children will be included in the view, this flag is only used
          in the situation where both parent and child attributes are published to the container. The default value is false.
    
      - fileName : fn                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the filename associated with the template.  This argument can be used in conjunction with load, save or query
          modes. If no filename is associated with a template, a default file name based on the template name will be used.  It is
          recommended but not required that the filename and template name correspond.
    
      - force : f                      (bool)          [create]
          This flag is used with some actions to allow them to proceed with an overwrite or destructive operation. When used with
          load, it will allow an existing template to be reloaded from a file.  When used in create mode, it will allow an
          existing template to be recreated (for example when using fromContainer argument to regenerate a template).
    
      - fromContainer : fc             (unicode)       [create]
          This argument is used in create or edit mode to specify a container node to be used for generating the template
          contents. In template creation mode, the template definition will be created based on the list of published attributes
          in the specified container. In edit mode, when used with the addNames flag or with no other flag, any published name on
          the container not present as an attribute on the template will be added to the template. This flag is also used in
          conjunction with flags such as addView.
    
      - fromSelection : fs             (bool)          [create,edit]
          If true, we will use the active selection list to create the template or the view. If allKeyable is also true then we
          will create the template from all keyable attributes in the selection, otherwise we will create the template using the
          attributes specified with the attribute flag.
    
      - layoutMode : lm                (int)           [create]
          This argument is used to specify the layout mode when creating a view. Values correspond as follows: 0: layout in flat
          list (default when not creating view from container) 1: layout grouped by node (default if creating view from container)
          The fromContainer or fromSelection argument is required to provide the reference container or selection for layout modes
          that require node information.  Note that views can only refer to defined template attributes. This means that when
          using the fromContainer or from Selection flag to add a view to an existing template, only attributes that are defined
          on both the template and the container or the current selection will be included in the view (i.e. published attributes
          on the container that are not defined in the template will be ignored).
    
      - load : l                       (bool)          []
          Load an existing template from a file. If a filename is specified for the template, the entire file (and all templates
          in it) will be loaded. If no file is specified, a default filename will be assumed, based on the template name.
    
      - matchFile : mf                 (unicode)       [query]
          Used in query mode in conjunction with other flags this flag specifies an optional file name that is to be matched as
          part of the query operation.
    
      - matchName : mn                 (unicode)       [query]
          Used in query mode in conjunction with other flags this flag specifies an optional template name that is to be matched
          as part of the query operation. The base template name is used for matching, any template with the same basename will be
          matched even across different packages.
    
      - parentAnchor : pan             (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag can be optionally specified when querying the publishedNodeList. The resulting list will contain only
          parentAnchor published nodes.
    
      - publishedNodeList : pnl        (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Used in query mode, returns a list of published nodes contained in the template definition. By default all published
          nodes on the template will be returned. The list of published nodes can be limited to only include certain types of
          published nodes using one of the childAnchor, parentAnchor or rootTransform flags. If an optional flag is are specified,
          only nodes of the specified type will be returned.
    
      - removeBindingSet : rbs         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          This argument is used to remove the named binding set from the template. The template must be saved before the binding
          set is permanently removed from the template file.
    
      - removeView : rv                (unicode)       [create,edit]
          This argument is used to remove the named view from the template. The template must be saved before the view is
          permanently removed from the template file.
    
      - rootTransform : rtn            (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag can be optionally specified when querying the publishedNodeList. The resulting list will contain only
          rootTransform published nodes.
    
      - save : s                       (bool)          [create]
          Save the specified template to a file. If a filename is specified for the template, the entire file (and all templates
          associated with it) will be saved. If no file name is specified, a default filename will be assumed, based on the
          template name.
    
      - searchPath : sp                (unicode)       [query,edit]
          The template searchPath is an ordered list of all locations that are being searched to locate template files (first
          location searched to last location searched). The template search path setting is stored in the current workspace and
          can also be set and queried as the file rule entry for 'templates' (see the workspace command for more information). In
          edit mode, this flag allows the search path setting to be customized. When setting the search path value, the list
          should conform to a path list format expected on the current platform.  This means that paths should be separated by a
          semicolon (;) on Windows and a colon (:) on Linux and MacOSX. Environment variables can also be used. Additional built-
          in paths may be added automatically by maya to the customized settings. In query mode, this flag returns the current
          contents of the search path; all paths, both customized and built-in, will be included in the query return value.
    
      - silent : si                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Silent mode will suppress any error or warning messages that would normally be reported from the command execution.  The
          return values are unaffected.
    
      - templateList : tl              (unicode)       [query]
          Used in query mode, returns a list of all loaded templates. This query can be used with optional matchFile and matchName
          flags. When used with the matchFile flag, the list of templates will be restricted to those associated with the
          specified file.  When used with the matchName flag, the list of templates will be restricted to those matching the
          specified template name.
    
      - unload : u                     (bool)          [create]
          Unload the specified template.  This action will not delete the associated template file if one exists, it merely
          removes the template definition from the current session.
    
      - updateBindingSet : ubs         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          This argument is used to update an existing binding set with new bindings. When used with the fromContainer argument
          binding set entries with be replaced or merged in the binding set based on the bindings of the designated container. If
          the force flag is used, existing entries in the binding set are replaced with new values. When force is not used, only
          new entries are merged into the binding set, any existing entries will be left as-is. When used without a reference
          container, the binding set will be updated with placeholder entries. The template must be saved before the new binding
          set is permanently stored with the template file.
    
      - useHierarchy : uh              (bool)          [create,edit]
          If true, and the fromSelection flag is set, the selection list will expand to include it's hierarchy also.
    
      - viewList : vl                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          Used in query mode, returns a list of all views defined on the template.                                   Flag can have

    This command returns the value of the named object's attribute. UI units are used where applicable. Currently, the types
    of attributes that can be displayed are: numeric attributesstring attributesmatrix attributesnumeric compound attributes

    contains no data.
    
    Maya Bug Fix:
      - maya pointlessly returned vector results as a tuple wrapped in a list ( ex.  '[(1,2,3)]' ). This command unpacks the vector for you.
    
    Modifications:
      - casts double3 datatypes to `Vector`
      - casts matrix datatypes to `Matrix`
      - casts vectorArrays from a flat array of floats to an array of Vectors
      - when getting a multi-attr, maya would raise an error, but pymel will return a list of values for the multi-attr
      - added a default argument. if the attribute does not exist and this argument is not None, this default value will be returned
      - added support for getting message attributes
    
    Flags:
      - asString : asString            (bool)          [create]
          This flag is only valid for enum attributes. It allows you to get the attribute values as strings instead of integer
          values. Note that the returned string value is dependent on the UI language Maya is running in (about -uiLanguage).
    
      - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the attribute is set to be cached internally
    
      - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the attribute is set to show in the channelBox. Keyable attributes also show in the channel box.
    
      - expandEnvironmentVariables : x (bool)          [create]
          Expand any environment variable and (tilde characters on UNIX) found in string attributes which are returned.
    
      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]

      - multiIndices : mi              (bool)          [create]
          If the attribute is a multi, this will return a list containing all of the valid indices for the attribute.
    
      - settable : se                  (bool)          [create]
          Returns 1 if this attribute is currently settable by setAttr, 0 otherwise. An attribute is settable if it's not locked
          and either not connected, or has only keyframed animation.
    
      - silent : sl                    (bool)          [create]
          When evaluating an attribute that is not a numeric or string value, suppress the error message saying that the data
          cannot be displayed. The attribute will be evaluated even though its data cannot be displayed. This flag does not
          suppress all error messages, only those that are benign.
    
      - size : s                       (bool)          [create]
          Returns the size of a multi-attribute array.  Returns 1 if non-multi.
    
      - time : t                       (time)          [create]
          Evaluate the attribute at the given time instead of the current time.
    
      - type : typ                     (bool)          [create]
          Returns the type of data currently in the attribute. Attributes of simple types such as strings and numerics always
          contain data, but attributes of complex types (arrays, meshes, etc) may contain no data if none has ever been assigned
          to them. When this happens the command will return with no result: not an empty string, but no result at all. Attempting
          to directly compare this non-result to another value or use it in an expression will result in an error, but you can
          assign it to a variable in which case the variable will be set to the default value for its type (e.g. an empty string
          for a string variable, zero for an integer variable, an empty array for an array variable). So to be safe when using
          this flag, always assign its result to a string variable, never try to use it directly.                   Flag can have
          multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    The rotate command is used to change the rotation of geometric objects. The rotation values are specified as Euler
    angles (rx, ry, rz). The values are interpreted based on the current working unit for Angular measurements. Most often

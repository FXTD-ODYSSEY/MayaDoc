              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - deleteKeyCommand : dkc         (script)        [create,edit]
              Specify the command to be executed when the delete or backspace key is pressed.
        
          - deselectAll : da               (bool)          [create,edit]

          - deselectIndexedItem : dii      (int)           [create,edit]
              Deselect the indexed item.  Indices are 1-based.
        
          - deselectItem : di              (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Deselect the item that contains the specified text.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
              Specify the command to be executed when an item is double clicked.
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfItems : ni             (bool)          [query]

              This flag can only be used in conjunction with the append or the appendPosition flag. The string specifies a unique tag
              for the appended item; the tag can then be used to query an item. This tag provides an alternate way to uniquely
              identify a list item using a string instead of by index. Tags are case insensitive.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - image : i                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - hsvValue : hsv                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]

          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]

          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - pressCommand : pc              (script)        [create,edit]

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rgbValue : rgb                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              Three float values corresponding to the red, green, and blue color components, all of which range from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - transparent : t                (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Set a given cell to be the transparent color.  A cell value of -1 indicates that no cell is transparent.  On query
              returns the current transparent cell.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

              a Windows only flag.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    This command creates a float slider containing two handles. The two handles are arranged such that they cannot pass one another, thus handle 1 will always have a value less than or or equal to handle 2 when you adjust the values. Each handle may have a MEL command associated with it which is issued when the handle moves and thus can be used to update the values of plugs such as via a setAttr command. Each handle can also be associated with a float textfield to display the current value of the handle. Note: the floatSlider2 widget currently only supports vertical (columnLayout) orientation.

        This command creates a float slider containing two handles. The two handles are arranged such that they cannot pass one
        another, thus handle 1 will always have a value less than or or equal to handle 2 when you adjust the values. Each
        handle may have a MEL command associated with it which is issued when the handle moves and thus can be used to update
        the values of plugs such as via a setAttr command. Each handle can also be associated with a float textfield to display
        the current value of the handle. Note: the floatSlider2 widget currently only supports vertical (columnLayout)
        orientation.
        
        Flags:

              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - changeCommand1 : cc1           (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Command to be associated with handle 1 and issued whenever the value of the handle is changed (except when values are
              changed via the -hv/handleValue flag). An example command might be setAttr nurbsSphere1.txand if handle 1 were to move
              to value 0.23 the slider would issue the command setAttr nurbsSphere1.tx 0.23;.
        
          - changeCommand2 : cc2           (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Command to be associated with handle 2 and issued whenever the value of the handle is changed (except when values are
              changed via the -hv/handleValue flag). An example command might be setAttr nurbsSphere1.txand if handle 2 were to move

          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - maximum : max                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Maximum limit of the slider. The default value is 10.0. The maximum value occurs at the top(right) end of the slider
              unless -polarity was specified. Note: you cannot set the maximum value greater than or equal to the current minimum.
        
          - minimum : min                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Minimum limit of the slider. The default value is 0.0. The minimum value occurs at the bottom end of the slider unless
              -polarity was specified. Note: you cannot set the minimum value greater than or equal to the current maximum.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - polarity : pol                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the polarity of the slider. If 0 (the default), the minimum value (specified by the -minimum flag) occurs at
              the bottom end of the slider and maximum at the top(right), with values increasing as the slider handles are moved
              towards the upper end of the slider. If the polarity is specified as 1, the reverse behaviour occurs, with the maximum
              occurring at the bottom end, the mimimum occuring at the top(right) end and values decreasing as the handles are moved
              towards the upper end.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - positionControl1 : pc1         (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 1 of this slider. The control must be a floatField.
              The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
        
          - positionControl2 : pc2         (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 2 of this slider. The control must be a floatField.
              The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - value1 : v1                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Value of handle 1. To ensure that handle 1 stays at or below handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too
              large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
        
          - value2 : v2                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Value of handle 2. To ensure that handle 2 stays at or above handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too
              large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
        
          - values : vs                    (float, float)  [create,edit]
              Sets the value for handles 1 and 2 simulteneously. The first argument is applied to handle 1 and must be less than or
              equal to the second (handle 2) argument or an error will be issued.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

          - command : c                    (script)        [create,edit]
              Set the command to call on a single click.
        
          - current : cr                   (bool)          [create,edit]

              all newly created objects into.  NB: Setting the layer button to this state has no effect on the actual current layer.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
              Set the command to call on a double click.
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - hideOnPlaybackCommand : hpc    (script)        [create,edit]
              Command that is called when the hide on playback indicator of the layer button is pressed.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - identification : id            (int)           [create,query,edit]

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - name : n                       (unicode)       [create,query]

          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - renameCommand : rc             (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Set the command to call when the layer gets renamed. The string '#1' will be substituted with the control's name and
              '#2' will be replaced with the layer's new name.

In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

              mandatory. If it is omitted, the inputs flag and the node must be used to specify the search targets. This allows
              attributeMenu to be used in the absence of a hypershade editor.

              be supplied.
        
          - regPulldownMenuCommand : rpm   (unicode)       [create]
              This flag will register a callback that allows the user to define their own popup menu for a specific node type for use
              in the Hypershade and Hypergraph editor. The command signature should look like this: global proc int proc_name(string
              $editorName, string $nodeName, string $plug, string $mode, string $menuType) The method should return 0 if it does not
              recognize the node type and the default attributeMenu popup menu will be displayed. If the callback returns one then the
              menu is considered built and no other menuItems will be added to the popup. The return value from this flag will be the
              ID to use for the -unregPulldownMenuCommand flag.
        
          - unregPulldownMenuCommand : upm (int)           [create]
              This flag will unregister a callback procedure that was registered with the -regPulldownMenuCommand flag. The argument
              should be the integer identifier returned from the -regPulldownMenuCommand flag.                                    Flag
              can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        This command creates an outliner editor which can be used to display a list of objects.WARNING: some flag combinations
        may not behave as you expect.  The command is really intended for internal use for creating the outliner used by the
        various editors.
        
        Flags:
          - allowMultiSelection : ams      (bool)          [create,edit]
              If true then multiple selection will be allowed in the outliner.
        
          - alwaysToggleSelect : ats       (bool)          [create,edit]
              If true, then clicking on an item in the outliner will select or deselect it without affecting the selection of other
              items (unless allowMultiSelection is false). If false, clicking on an item in the outliner will replace the current
              selection with the selected item.
        
          - animLayerFilterOptions : alf   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies whether a filter is to be applied when displaying animation layers. If so, the options can be allAffecting(no
              filter), active(only the active layers on the object will be displayed) and animLayerEditor(the settings will be taken
              from the animation layer editor).
        
          - attrAlphaOrder : aao           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify how attributes are to be sorted. Current recognised values are defaultfor no sorting and ascendto sort
              attributes from 'a' to ''z' and descendto sort from 'z' to 'a'. Notes: a) this only applies to top level attributes.
        
          - attrFilter : af                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on this editor. This filters the attributes displayed in the
              editor.
        
          - autoExpand : xpd               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not objects that are loaded in should have their attributes automatically expanded.
        
          - autoExpandLayers : ael         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true then when a node with animation layer is displayed, all the animation layers will show up in expanded form.
        
          - autoSelectNewObjects : autoSelectNewObjects (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not new objects added to the outliner should be automatically selected.

              This flag specifices whether or not filters should be ignored when displaying container contents.
        
          - control : ctl                  (bool)          [query]
              Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.
              Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return NONEif no control is present.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

              If true then clicking on an item in the outliner will add or remove just that item from the selection connection. If
              false then clicking on an item in the outliner causes the selection connection to be reloaded with the currently
              selected items in the outliner.
        
          - displayMode : dm               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Affects how the outliner displays when a filter is applied. List mode is a non-indented flat list. DAG mode indents to
              represent the hierarchical structure of the model.
        
          - doNotSelectNewObjects : dns    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true this flag specifies that new objects added to the outliner will not be selected, even if they are active.

          - dropIsParent : dip             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies the mode for drag and drop. If the flag is true, dropping items will do a reparent. If it is false,
              dropping will reorder items. By default, the flag is true (parent).
        
          - editAttrName : ean             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not attribute names can be edited. By default double-clicking on an attribute will open
              the expression editor for that attribute.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - expandAllItems : eai           (bool)          [create,edit]
              Expand or collapse all items in the outliner.

              Force the outliner to fill the selection list with only attributes.
        
          - expandConnections : xc         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not attributes should be expanded to show their input connections. Note: currently the
              expansion will only show animCurves.
        
          - expandObjects : eo             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not objects that are loaded in should be automatically expanded.
        
          - feedbackItemName : fbn         (bool)          [query]
              Returns the outliner item name at the current mouse position, if any.

              Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the
              main list of the editor.
        
          - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
              only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
              that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
              -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        
          - getCurrentSetOfItem : gcs      (int)           [query]
              Returns the current set of item at the given row. As an item can belong to number of sets, current set is the set to
              which the item belongs to currently.
        
          - highlightActive : ha           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are active. Note: if the outliner is
              driving the contents of another editor, setting highlightActive to true may produce unexpected behavior.
        
          - highlightConnection : hlc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all
              editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        
          - highlightSecondary : hs        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are contained in the highlightConnection.
        
          - ignoreDagHierarchy : hir       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not DAG objects are displayed in their DAG hierarchy. Warning: using this flag without
              some other form of sensible filtering will lead to a very confusing outliner.
        
          - ignoreHiddenAttribute : iha    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'hidden in outliner' flag on nodes.

              Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'use outliner color' flag on nodes.
        
          - isChildSelected : ics          (PyNode)        [query]
              This flag allows you to query if one or more of the children of the specified item is selected in the outliner. The item
              should be specified using a unique DAG path. Note that if the specified item appears multiple times in the outliner, the
              result will be true if one or more children of any occurrence of the specified item in the outliner is/are selected.
        
          - isSet : isSet                  (int)           [query]
              Returns true if the item present at the given row is a set.

              Returns true if the item present at the given row is a set member.
        
          - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
              Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
              Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        
          - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [query,edit]
              Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the
              -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
              only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        
          - mapMotionTrails : mmt          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets whether or not we replace the motion trail in the outliner with the object it is trailing.
        
          - masterOutliner : mst           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              This flag is the name of an outliner that this outliner will share the objects and state from. When an outliner is
              shared, all of its state information comes from, and is applied to, the master outliner.
        
          - niceNames : nn                 (bool)          [query,edit]
              Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
              longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
              longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - object : obj                   (PyNode)        [query]
              This flags is used together with the parentObjectflag to get the name of the parent object for the specified object.

              If true then when a node with animation layer is displayed, attributes will be displayed according to the layer(s) it
              belongs to. eg:  Layer1 Attr1 Attr2 Layer2 Attr1  If it is false then the outliner will be organized primarily by
              attributes. eg:  Attr1 Layer1 Layer2 Attr2 Layer1
        
          - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
              Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
              will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
              deleted.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        
          - parentObject : po              (bool)          [query]

              Pins the named plug, so it always appears in the outliner, irrespective of the incoming selection connection. In query
              mode, returns a list of the pinned plugs.
        
          - refresh : rfs                  (bool)          [edit]
              Causes the outliner to refresh itself.
        
          - removeFromCurrentSet : rcs     (int)           [edit]
              Removes selected members of a set from their current set. Current set is the set to which item at the given row belongs
              to. If no selected items, the item at the given row is removed from its current set.
        
          - renameItem : rni               (int)           [edit]
              Renames the item at the given row index in the outliner.
        
          - renameSelectedItem : rsi       (bool)          [edit]
              Rename the first selected item in the outliner.
        
          - renderFilterActive : rfa       (bool)          [query]
              This is a query only flag which returns true if the render setup filter is Active, i.e one of the four render filters
              (Inside Selected, Outside Selected, Inside All Layers, Outside All Layers) is applied on the outliner currently, false
              otherwise.
        
          - renderFilterIndex : rfi        (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Sets the Render Setup Filter to the index passed. This only works if the filter is visible in outliner and its selection
              is not locked. Valid indices are: 0 - Scene2 - Inside Selected3 - Outside Selected4 - Inside All Layers5 - Outside All
              LayersDefault: Scene 0 In query mode returns current index of the filter.
        
          - renderFilterVisible : rfv      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Show/Hide the Render Setup Filter in outliner. In query mode returns whether the Render Setup Filter is visible or not.

              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
              user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
              changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        
          - selectionOrder : sod           (unicode)       [edit]
              Specify how objects are sorted in selection list. Current recognised values are selectionfor sorting in selection order
              and displayto sort objects in the same order that the outliner does.
        
          - setFilter : sf                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              Specifies whether to show attributes or not.
        
          - showCompounds : cmp            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies whether or not compound attributes should be displayed, or just the leaf attributes. Note: if
              showConnected is true, and the compound attribute is connected, it will still be displayed.

              Specifies exactly which attributes are displayed when showAttributes and expandConnections are both true. If true, the
              dependency graph is searched upstream for all curves that drive the selected plugs (showing multiple curves for example
              in a typical driven key setup, where first the driven key curve is encountered, followed by the actual animation curve
              that drives the source object). If false, only the first curves encountered will be shown. Note that, even if false,
              multiple curves can be shown if e.g. a blendWeighted node is being used to combine multiple curves.
        
          - sortOrder : so                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify how objects are to be sorted.  Current recognised values are nonefor no sorting and dagNameto sort DAG objects
              by name. Notes: a) non-DAG objects are always sorted by nodeType and name. b) when sortOrder is set to dagName, objects
              cannot be reordered using drag-and-drop, they can however be reparented.
        
          - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
              Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
              command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        
          - transmitFilters : tf           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              This flag specifies how the selectionConnection is populated when attribute filters are enabled.  If this flag is set to
              true, then all the attributes that pass the filter will be placed on the selectionConnection.  By default this flag is
              false.
        
          - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]

              Unpins the named plug.
        
          - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
              Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.                  Flag can have multiple
              arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Specify true to break lines at spaces, tabs, or newlines.  Text will continue on the following line.  A value of false
              will not break text between words, in which case text may disappear beyond the edge of the field.  This flag must be set

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - horizontal : hr                (bool)          [create,query]
              Orientation of the slider.  This flag is true by default which corresponds to a horizontally oriented slider.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Upper limit of the slider.

              Lower limit of the slider.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - step : s                       (float)         [create,query,edit]
              The step value represents the amount the value will increase or decrease when you click either side of the slider.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - value : v                      (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Value of the slider.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    class counterpart of mel function `menuEditor`
    
    A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items to be edited. Menu items are represented by labelled icons which can be dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout.  Various objects can be dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items: toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons from the shelf, iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window. When editing a Marking Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons arranged in a circle within the menuEditor.  Overflow items in the Marking Menu (or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial items. To edit a submenu of a popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created (typically within its own window) and attached to its parent menuEditor. Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument.  For these, positions are specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string corresponds to a radial position (possibily None) and the int corresponds to a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none).  Radial positions are specified by one of (N,0), (NE,0), (E,0), (SE,0), (S,0), (SW,0), (W,0) or (NW,0).  Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with (None,i), where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within the overflow column.Note:This command is not meant to be called explicitly. It was created to support the Marking Menu editor. It is recommended that you use that editor to modify marking menus.

        A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items to be edited. Menu items are represented
        by labelled icons which can be dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout.  Various objects can be
        dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items: toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons
        from the shelf, iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window. When editing a Marking
        Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons arranged in a circle within the menuEditor.  Overflow items in the
        Marking Menu (or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial items. To edit a submenu of a
        popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created (typically within its own window) and attached to its parent
        menuEditor. Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument.  For these, positions are
        specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string corresponds to a radial position (possibily None) and the int
        corresponds to a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none).  Radial positions are specified by one of (N,0),
        (NE,0), (E,0), (SE,0), (S,0), (SW,0), (W,0) or (NW,0).  Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with (None,i),
        where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within the overflow column.Note:This command is not meant to
        be called explicitly. It was created to support the Marking Menu editor. It is recommended that you use that editor to
        modify marking menus.

              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

              menuEditor is open and attached to it, then the sub-menuEditor's window and all its child menuEditor windows will be

          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

          - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - iconMenuCallback : imc         (unicode)       [create]
              This is the name of a MEL callback procedure that is called to create the popup menus attached to icons in the
              menuEditor.  The callback is called once for each newly created icon, and once each time an icon is moved within the
              menuEditor.  Popup menus created by the callback should contain commands for editing the menu item associated with the
              icon.  Operations accessible through the menu should include deletion of the item, editing of the item's
              label/command/image/checkbox/optionbox, creation of a submenu, and popping up a sub-menuEditor. The arguments to the
              callback must match this form: callbackProc(string $menuEditorName, string $parentIconName, string $menuTitle, string
              $radialPosition, int $overflowRow); The popup menu's parent should be $parentIconName. Note that when a sub-menuEditor
              is created, this flag need not be re-specified as it adopts a default value equal to the value of its parent
              menuEditor's -imc/iconMenuCallback flag.
        
          - image : i                      (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]

              item. The arguments are the icon filename, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is
              returned containing all the icon filenames. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
              NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - menuItemTypes : mit            (bool)          [query]
              This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of strings indicating the type of contents in each cell of the menuEditor.
              Cells can be vacant, or may contain a regular menu item, or a separator, or a submenuitem.  In each case, the
              corresponding string is returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW),
              and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

              script name, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have an
              associated option box item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries
              of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or
              linear) menu items.
        
          - optionBoxPresent : obp         (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
              This controls whether a menu item has an associated option box item or not. The arguments are a flag indicating
              presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - radioButtonPresent : rbp       (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
              This controls whether a menu item has a radio button or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by
              the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans
              is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ...
              NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        
          - radioButtonState : rbs         (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]

              position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a radio button. If queried, an array of
              booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
              NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        
          - separator : sp                 (unicode, int)  [query,edit]
              In edit mode this adds a separator to the menuEditor at the specified position. The parameters are the radialPosition
              and the overflowRow. If queried, an array of booleans is returned indicating if the item is a separator item. The first
              8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to
              overflow (or linear) menu items.

          - subMenuAt : sma                (unicode, int)  [edit]
              Creates a submenu item at the given position.  A submenu item created within the radial portion of a menu will overwrite
              whatever item (if any) is currently at the given position. A submenu item created within the overflow (linear) portion
              of a menu will be inserted before the item currently at the given position.
        
          - subMenuEditorWindow : sew      (unicode)       [create]
              The name of the window which contains a sub-menuEditor.  Only use when creatitg a sub-menuEditor. This window will
              automatically be closed if a parent menuEditor is closed or if a parent menu item is deleted.
        
          - subMenuEditorsOpen : seo       (bool)          [query]
              This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of booleans, each of which indicates if a sub-menuEditor is open and
              attached to the menu item in a particular cell.  One boolean is returned for each cell in the menuEditor, even if the
              cell is vacant or contains a non-submenu item (false will be returned in both these cases).  Only when a cell contains a
              submenu item can true possibily be returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
              NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

              of the parent menuEditor, followed by the position of a submenu item within the parent. A submenu item must already
              exist within the parent at the given position. A submenu item cannot have multiple sub-menuEditors attached to it.
        
          - topLevelMenu : tlm             (unicode)       [query,edit]
              The popup menu to attach to the editor.  All editing operations performed in the editor (i.e. inserting/deleting/moving
              an item) will be immediately reflected in this menu. This flag is ignored if the editor is a sub-menuEditor.  The editor
              will update gracefully if the value of the flag is changed from its initial value.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

As many pairs of strings can be returned as the number of active cameras. If nothing is returned then it is assumed that no set up is required to activate a given camera.

              For model editors with filtering on (either using an object filter, or isolate select), this flag returns a string list
              of the objects which are displayed in this editor. Note that this list does not take into account visibility (based on
              camera frustum or flags), it purely captures the objects which are considered when rendering the view.

              1.0] to the range [0.0, maxConstantTransparency]. All transparency values are shifted linearly to the new range, so a
              fully transparency object (transparency 1.0) would appear with a transparency of maxConstantTransparency in the
              viewport, allowing highly transparent objects to be made visible.  This flag only affects constant (non-textured)
              transparent objects.

              created via the API (i.e. the flag would be used on the derived MPxModelEditorCommand), though the flag may also be used
              on the base modelEditor command to restore a default Maya model editor to the panel. Note that the model editor
              previously owned by the panel is deleted.

              to their origin in camera space but when this flag is turned off they will be drawn according to their (depth-first
              traversal) order in the scene graph. This is a global flag that affects all model editors.
        
          - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
              Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
              command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.

              fragment. The source is usually the material color. Argument options are: modulate: multiply the destination and texture
              fragment decal: overwrite the destination with the texture fragment

              Set maximum texture size for hardware texturing.  The integer value must be a power of 2.  Recommended values are 128 or
              256.  If the value specified is larger than the OpenGL maximim textures size for the graphics hardware it will be
              clamped to the OpenGL size.  If many large textures are used in a scene reducing this value improves performance.  On
              Impact texture memory is pinned in RAM so using large textures can cause reliability and performance problems. Again
              reducing this value will help. Software rendering does not use this value. This flag is obsolete as of Maya 6.5. The
              maxTextureResolution/mtr argument on the displayPref command should be used instead.
        
          - textureMemoryUsed : tmu        (bool)          [query]
              Returns the total number of bytes used by all texture maps.  This is typicly width\*height\*channels for all texture

              than two level will be in use at one time
        
          - textureSampling : ts           (int)           [query,edit]
              Set the type of sampling to be used for texture display. The argument can be either: 1 : means to perform point sample2

          - textures : tx                  (bool)          [query,edit]
              Turn on/off the display of texture objects for the view

              Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.
              Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return NONEif no control is present.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

              Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the
              main list of the editor.
        
          - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
              only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
              that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
              -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        
          - highlightConnection : hlc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all
              editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        
          - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
              Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
              Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        
          - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
              only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        
          - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
              Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
              will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
              deleted.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        
          - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
              user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
              changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        
          - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
              Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
              command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        
          - targetControlList : tcl        (bool)          [query]

              Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        
          - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
              Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
              updates.
        
          - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]

          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
              a Windows only flag.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              If you are not providing images with different sizes then you may use this flag for the control's image. If the
              iconOnlystyle is set, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        
          - image1 : i1                    (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
              otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only
              accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as 2014).

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - columnWidth6 : cw6             (int, int, int, int, int, int) [create,edit]

          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - precision : pre                (int)           [query,edit]
              Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels.
              Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment
              types and offsets for the entire row.

          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - valueAnnotation : van          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the value field with an extra string value.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when dragging in the field.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        
          - loadImage : li                 (unicode)       [edit]
              load an image from disk and set it as the current Editor Image
        
          - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
              Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
              Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        
          - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
              only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        
          - marquee : mq                   (float, float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The arguments define the four corners of a rectangle: top left bottom right. The rectangle defines a marquee for the
              render computation.

          - nextViewImage : nvi            (bool)          [create,edit]
              The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
              binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
              side. The nextViewImage flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism to store to
              the next view location.
        
          - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
              Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
              will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
              deleted.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        
          - pcaption : pca                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Get or set the permanent caption which appears under the image that is currently showing in the render editor.
        
          - realSize : rs                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Display the image with a one to one pixel match.
        
          - refresh : ref                  (bool)          [edit]
              requests a refresh of the current Editor Image.
        
          - removeAllImages : ra           (bool)          [edit]
              remove all the Editor Images from the Editor Image Stack
        
          - removeImage : ri               (bool)          [edit]
              remove the current Editor Image from the Editor Image Stack
        
          - resetRegion : rr               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Forces a reset of any marquee/region.
        
          - resetViewImage : rvi           (bool)          [create,edit]
              The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
              binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
              side. The resetViewImage flag tells the editor that it should reset its internal image storage mechanism to the first
              image. This would happen at the very start of a render view render.
        
          - saveImage : si                 (bool)          [edit]
              save the current Editor Image to memory. Saved Editor Images are stored in an Editor Image Stack. The most recently
              saved image is stored in position 0, the second most recently saved image in position 1, and so on... To set the current
              Editor Image to a previously saved image use the di/displayImageflag.
        
          - scaleBlue : sb                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Define the scaling factor for the blue component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000
        
          - scaleGreen : sg                (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Define the scaling factor for the green component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000
        
          - scaleRed : sr                  (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Define the scaling factor for the red component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000
        
          - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
              user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
              changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        
          - showRegion : srg               (int, int)      [create,query,edit]
              Shows the current region at the given resolution. The two parameters define the width and height.
        
          - singleBuffer : sbf             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Set the display in single buffer mode
        
          - snapshot : snp                 (unicode, int, int) [create,query,edit]
              Makes a copy of the camera of the model editor at the given size. First argument is the editor name, second is the
              width, third is the height.
        
          - snapshotMode : snm             (bool)          []
        
          - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
              Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
              command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        
          - stereo : s                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Puts the editor into stereo image mode.  The effective resolution of the output image is twice the size of the
              horizontal size. The orientation of the images can be set using the stereoOrientation flag.
        
          - stereoImageOrientation : sio   (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the orientation of stereo camera renders.  The first argument specifies the orientation value for the
              firstleft image and the second argument specifies the orientation value for the right image. The orientation values are
              'normal', the image appears as seen throught he camera, or 'mirrored', the image is mirrored horizontally.
        
          - stereoMode : sm                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies how the image is displayed in the view.  By default the stereo is rendered with a side by side image.  The
              rendered image is a single image that is twice the size of a normal image, 'both'. Users can also choose to display as
              'redcyan', 'redcyanlum', 'leftonly', 'rightonly', or 'stereo'.  both - displays both the left and right redcyan -
              displays the images as a red/cyan pair. redcyanlum - displays the luminance of the images as a red/cyan pair. leftonly -
              displays the left side only rightonly - displays the right side only stereo - mode that supports Crystal Eyes(tm) or
              Zscreen (tm) renders
        
          - toggle : tgl                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Turns the ground plane display on/off.
        
          - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
              Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        
          - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
              Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
              updates.
        
          - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
              Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - viewImageCount : vic           (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
              binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
              side. The viewImageCount flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism for a given
              number of views.
        
          - viewTransformName : vtn        (unicode)       [query,edit]
              Sets/gets the view transform to be applied if color management is enabled in the current view.
        
          - writeImage : wi                (unicode)       [edit]
              write the current Editor Image to disk                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a
              list.

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]

          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
              onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the
              callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        
          - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create]
              To explicitly add the control to the specified collection.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              image specified with the -i/imageflag. This is a Windows only flag.
        
          - selectionImage : si            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Image displayed while the control is selected. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the -i/imageflag.
              This is a Windows only flag.
        
          - style : st                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are iconOnly, textOnly, iconAndTextHorizontal, iconAndTextVertical, and
              iconAndTextCentered. (Note: iconAndTextCenteredis only available on Windows). If the iconOnlystyle is set, the icon will
              be scaled to the size of the control.

              number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as
              2014).
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]

              inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        
          - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create]

          - data : da                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              can always be changed with the -sl/selectflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

          - dropRectCallback : drc         (script)        [edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of
              the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y) The return value is an
              array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn,
              followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]

          - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
              will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

        This command creates a toolButton that is added to the most recently created tool button collection unless the
        cl/collectionflag is used. It also attaches the named tool, activating it when this control is selected. By default,
        this control only handles one tool at a time.  Using the t/toolflag to associate a new tool will simply override the
        previous attached tool.  If you use the amt/allowMultipleToolsflag then you will be able to attach more than one tool
        with this control.  Only one tool will be current within the control.  To access the other tools press the right mouse
        button to display a popup menu containing all the tools associated with this control.  If you set the

          - allowMultipleTools : amt       (bool)          [create,query]
              Indicates whether this control will allow you to attach more than one tool.  By default, this control accepts only one
              tool. You can add multiple tools by setting this flag to true. Only one tool will be current and displayed at any one
              time. Use the pop up menu attached to the right mouse button to view all the tools.
        
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
              onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the
              callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        
          - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create,edit]
              To explicitly add a tool button to a tool collection.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the control is double clicked.
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

              This control supports three images.  The image that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.  This
              flag applies the image to the current tool.
        
          - imageOverlayLabel : iol        (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              A short string (5 characters) label that will be displayed on top of the icon.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - ltVersion : lt                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              This flag is used to specify the Maya LT version that this control feature was introduced, if the version flag is not
              specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
              otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only
              accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as 2014).
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - offCommand : ofc               (script)        [create,edit]

              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupIndicatorVisible : piv    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Edit this flag to set the visibility of the popup tool indicator. The indicator is a simple image that appears in the
              top right corner of the button when more that one tool is associated with this control. This flag is queryable and true
              by default.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - select : sl                    (bool)          [create,edit]
              Will set this button as the selected one.  This flag also queries the select state of the control.
        
          - style : st                     (unicode)       [create,edit]
              The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are iconOnly, textOnly, iconAndTextHorizontaland iconAndTextVertical.

              The name of the tool to be attached to the button.  If the tool specified is already attached to this button then it
              will be selected.  Query this flag to return the current tool.  This flag may be specified more than once to attach more
              than one tool.
        
          - toolArray : ta                 (bool)          [query]
              This query only flag returns the names of all the tools attached to the toolButton control.
        
          - toolCount : tc                 (bool)          [query]

          - toolImage3 : ti3               (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
              This control supports three images.  The image that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.  This
              flag applies the image to the specified tool.  The first argument is the name of the tool and the second is the name of
              the image.  When queried an array of tool icon pairs is returned.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

              version number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be
              given as 2014).
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - drawInactiveFrame : dif        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets whether the name field draws itself with a frame when it is inactive. By default, this option is false.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

              whether or not the name-change originated with the user typing into the field. If you want to attach a command to be
              executed when the user types into the field, use the -cc/changeCommand flag.

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - receiveFocusCommand : rfc      (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command executed when the field receives focus.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

        Flags:
          - afterCellChangedCmd : acc      (script)        [create,edit]
              Sets the script to call after the value of a cell has been changed. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments
              specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into
              that cell. The procedure does not need to return any value. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1)
              is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form: global proc procedureName(int $row, int $column, string
              $value)
        
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - cellBackgroundColorCommand : cbc (script)        [create,edit]
              Sets the script to call when it requires the background color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer
              arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints
              which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper
              left cell). The procedure should be of the form: global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) { return

              Sets the script to call when somebody has changed the value of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments
              specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into
              that cell. The procedure should return an integer value which indicates whether that value should be accepted (return 1
              if yes, and 0 if no). The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The
              procedure should be of the form: global proc int procedureName(int $row, int $column, string $value)
        
          - cellForegroundColorCommand : cfc (script)        [create,edit]
              Sets the script to call when it requires the foreground color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer
              arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints
              which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper
              left cell). The procedure should be of the form: global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) { return

          - cellIndex : ci                 (int, int)      [query,edit]
              used with cellValue , to give the index of row and column This flag and its argument must be passed to the command
              before the -q flag (see examples).
        
          - cellValue : cv                 (unicode)       [query,edit]

              flag -multiEditEnabled is True and any cell is selected, the flag -cellIndex is not used and the selected cells will be
              changed.
        
          - clearRow : cr                  (int)           [edit]
              Clear the contents for all the cells on the specified row. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to
              populate the cleared cells The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        
          - clearTable : ct                (bool)          [edit]

          - columnFilter : cf              (int, unicode)  [create,edit]
              Filter the specified column with the string value provided. Set filter to columns 0 will apply the filter to all
              columns. The filter is case insensitive and support wildcards. Wildcard Matching: Wildcard matching is much simpler than
              full regexps and has only four features: c    Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below. Thus c
              matches the character c. ?     Matches any single character. It is the same as . in full regexps. \*   Matches zero or
              more of any characters. It is the same as .\* in full regexps. [...]    Sets of characters can be represented in square
              brackets, similar to full regexps. Within the character class, backslash has no special meaning. (i.e. you can search
              for MyValuewith y\*uor ??Val??or [MyThe]Valueor any letters in MyValueThe column number is 1-based (i.e. the first row
              is 1 not 0).

          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - deleteRow : dr                 (int)           [edit]
              Delete the specified row The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The edit state of the table. By default, this flag is set to true, and the table can be edited. If false, then the table

          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              Sets the script to call when it requires the contents of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments
              specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return a string which is the value
              for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (ie. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should
              be of the form: global proc string procedureName(int $row, int $column)
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - insertRow : ir                 (int)           [edit]
              Insert an empty row before the specified row. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the
              new new cells. The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

              usual way, the selection is cleared and the new item selected. However, if the user presses the Ctrl key when clicking
              on an item, the clicked item gets toggled and all other items are left untouched. If the user presses the Shift key
              while clicking on an item, all items between the current item and the clicked item are selected or unselected, depending
              on the state of the clicked item. Multiple items can be selected by dragging the mouse over them.4 - When the user
              selects an item in the usual way, the selection is cleared and the new item selected. However, if the user presses the

          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the text changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -tx/text flag.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - disableButtons : db            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets the visibility state of search field buttons to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode returns
              whether both buttons are visible or not.
        
          - disableClearButton : dcb       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets the visibility state of search field clear button to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode
              returns whether clear button of search field is visible or not.
        
          - disableHistoryButton : dhb     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets the visibility state of search field history button to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode
              returns whether history button of search field is visible or not.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - drawInactiveFrame : dif        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Sets whether the text field draws itself with a frame when it's inactive. By default, this option is false.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
              If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the
              -tx/text flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

              Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
        
          - insertionPosition : ip         (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the
              field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

              Setting this property makes the line edit display a grayed-out placeholder text as long as the text field is empty and
              the widget doesn't have focus. By default, this property contains an empty string.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - receiveFocusCommand : rfc      (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the field receives focus.
        
          - searchField : sf               (bool)          [create]

              Command executed immediately when the field text changes.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

              Specify a short (5 character) text string to be overlayed on top of the icon associated with the menu item. This is
              primarily a mechanism for differentiating menu items that are using a Family icon due to the fact that an icon image had
              not been explicitly defined. The image overlay label will not be used if an icon image is defined for the menu item.
        
          - insertAfter : ia               (unicode)       [create]

              Specify if text should be italicized. Only supported in menus which use the marking menu implementation.  Default is
              false.
        
          - keyEquivalent : ke             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
              otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only
              accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as 2014).

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is

By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the value changes by dragging the invisible slider.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    class counterpart of mel function `hyperGraph`
    
    The following is an overview of the basic features of the hypergraph. A more detailed description is given in the user manuals. The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya scene graph.  The hypergraph supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene hierarchy and the dependency graph. The default view of the hypergraph editor is the DAG view. The user can show the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options.  The user can save any view by setting a bookmark to that view.  The user can also show previous views using the view options provided. The hypergraph supports a simple editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG  view, the user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the dependency graph view, the user can select connections and delete them or make new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections. The hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and freeform.  In automatic mode, the graph nodes are automatically positioned according to the layout preferences.  In freeform mode, the user can position nodes manually.  The node position is saved in the scene. A background image can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be used as a template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout. Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed.  The state is saved in the scene.  The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are collapsed. In addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression, constraint and deformation relationships in the DAG. These can be enabled/disabled through the options provided.  There are also additional filters for showing shape nodes and invisible nodes.  The amount of detail show may affect the speed of the display of the graph. Most of the UI features of the hypergraph are addressable through the hypergraph command-line interface.  The available command-line options are described in the next section.

        The following is an overview of the basic features of the hypergraph. A more detailed description is given in the user
        manuals. The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya scene graph.  The hypergraph
        supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene hierarchy and the dependency graph. The default view of the hypergraph
        editor is the DAG view. The user can show the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes
        and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options.  The user can save any view by setting a bookmark
        to that view.  The user can also show previous views using the view options provided. The hypergraph supports a simple
        editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG  view, the
        user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the dependency graph view, the user can select
        connections and delete them or make new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections. The
        hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and freeform.  In automatic mode, the graph nodes are
        automatically positioned according to the layout preferences.  In freeform mode, the user can position nodes manually.
        The node position is saved in the scene. A background image can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be
        used as a template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout. Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed.
        The state is saved in the scene.  The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are collapsed. In
        addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression, constraint and deformation relationships in the
        DAG. These can be enabled/disabled through the options provided.  There are also additional filters for showing shape
        nodes and invisible nodes.  The amount of detail show may affect the speed of the display of the graph. Most of the UI
        features of the hypergraph are addressable through the hypergraph command-line interface.  The available command-line
        options are described in the next section.
        
        Flags:
          - addBookmark : abk              (bool)          [create,edit]
              Create a bookmark for the current hypergraph view.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragFeedbackVisible : dfv      (bool)          []
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - dropRectCallback : drc         (script)        [edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of
              the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y) The return value is an
              array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn,
              followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - style : st                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify the style of the separator.  Valid values are none, single, in, outand shelf.  Note: the values double,
              singleDashand doubleDashand no longer supported.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

              a Windows only flag.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command executed when the control is double clicked.
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and

    This command creates a scrolling field that behaves similar to a unix shell for entering user input.  You may specify the number of lines that will be remembered by the field with the -nsl/numberOfSavedLines flag.  The default number of lines saved is 100.  The shellField also maintains a command history buffer. You can specify the number of input lines that will be saved with the -hlc/historyLineCount flag.  The default size of this buffer is 10.

The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site.

              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfHistoryLines : nhl     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The number of input lines to be saved in the command history buffer.  You can cycle through this buffer by pressing the
              up and down arrow keys.  Valid values are 0 through 32767.  Any value less than 0 will be handled as if 0 was specified.
              Similarly, any value greater than 32767 will be handled as if 32767 was specified.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

              The total number of lines (the scrolled lines and currently visible lines) that will be remembered by the field. Any
              lines beyond this number will be lost, and the user will not be able to review them by scrolling.  Valid values are 1
              through 32767.  Any value less than 1 will be handled as if 1 was specified.  Similarly, any value greater than 32767
              will be handled as if 32767 was specified.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - prompt : pr                    (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The text that is used as a prompt.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]

          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
              will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - value : v                      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              State of the check box.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [edit]
              Specifies a command to be executed whenever the value of this ramp is modified. This option should not be used when
              specifying an optionVar.
        
          - currentKey : ck                (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Returns the index of the currently selected key.
        
          - currentKeyChanged : ckc        (script)        [edit]
              Specifies a command to be executed whenever the selected key changes.
        
          - currentKeyColorValue : clv     (float, float, float) [query,edit]
              Get or set the color of the currently selected key. Only useful if the ramp is set to be a color ramp.
        
          - currentKeyCurveValue : cvv     (bool)          [query,edit]

          - currentKeyInterpValue : civ    (int)           [query,edit]
              Get or set the interpolation value for the current key.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [edit]
              Specifies a command to be executed while the ramp is being modified.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]

The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

          - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is

              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfControls : nc          (int)           [query]

          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - refreshOnRelease : ror         (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Define how updates are dispatched during interactive editing of the ramp widget. True causes updates to only dispatch
              after releasing the mouse button after editing. False (the default) causes updates to dispatch interactively during
              editing (e.g. while moving ramp curve points). Note that the global update mode, if set to on releasecan disable the
              effect of this option.
        
          - selectedColorControl : scc     (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Specifies the name of a color control to edit the selected color.
        
          - selectedInterpControl : sic    (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Specifies the name of an enum control to edit the selected interpolation.
        
          - selectedPositionControl : spc  (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Specifies the name of a float slider to edit the selected position.
        
          - staticNumberOfControls : snc   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              When 'true', this flag disables the creation/deletion of ramp entries (control points) via ramp widget interaction.
              Default is false.
        
          - staticPositions : sp           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              When 'true', this flag disables the interactive modification of ramp entry positions. Default is false.
        
          - upperLimitControl : ulc        (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify the name of a text control which is updated with the current upper display limit for the ramp. This option is
              only effective when adaptiveScaling is specified.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - verticalLayout : vl            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              When 'true', this makes the control orient vertically rather than horizontally. The default is `false` or horizontal.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the value changes by dragging the scroll bar's value marker.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        This command creates a channel box, which is sensitive to the active list.  It displays certain attributes (channels) of
        the last node on the active list, and provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date. Note: when setting
        the color of attribute names, that color is only valid for its current Maya session; each subsequent session will
        display the default color for the attribute name(s) listed in the Channel Box. Any subsequent attributes that are added

        Flags:
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - attrBgColor : bc               (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              Controls the background text color of specific attribute names. As with the foreground option, this text coloring also
              depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color
              components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of
              \*for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed
              will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.
        
          - attrColor : ac                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              Controls the foreground text color of specific attribute names. This text coloring also depends on the node name choice
              for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in
              value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*for a regular expression. The same
              idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be
              affected in the channel box.
        
          - attrFilter : af                (unicode)       [query,edit]
              Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on the channel box. This filters the attributes displayed. A
              filter of 0can be used to reset the filter.
        
          - attrRegex : ar                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which attribute names should be selected for foreground text coloring.
              If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously
              applies to the flag nodeRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be
              treated as though it were case-insensitve
        
          - attributeEditorMode : aem      (bool)          [query,edit]
              Modifies what appears in the channel box for use in the attribute editor. Default is false. Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - containerAtTop : cat           (bool)          [query,edit]
              This flag can be used to specify whether or not the container is drawn at the top of the channel box when a node in the
              container is selected.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - enableLabelSelection : els     (bool)          [query,edit]
              Enables the selection of attributes in the channelBox when used in conjunction with -attributeEditorMode. Default is
              false.  Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - execute : exe                  (unicode, bool) [edit]
              Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in
              the channel box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell
              value.)  Before the command is executed, #Ais substituted with the name of the attribute, and #Nwith the name of the
              node, and #Pwith the full path name of the node.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - fieldWidth : fw                (int)           [query,edit]
              An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to fields appearing in the channelBox.
        
          - fixedAttrList : fal            (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [create,query,edit]
              Forces the channel box to only display attributes with the specified names, in the order they are specified.  If an
              empty list is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of listing all keyable attributes.
        
          - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - historyObjectList : hol        (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of every INPUT node associated with an object on the main object list that is of
              the same type as the node displayed in the INPUT section of the channel box.
        
          - hyperbolic : hyp               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Determines whether or not the distance that the mouse has been dragged should be interpreted as a linear or hyperbolic
              function.  The default is set to hyperbolic being false.
        
          - inputs : inputs                (bool)          [query]
              Returns the items shown under the 'INPUTS' heading in the channel box.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - labelWidth : lw                (int)           [query,edit]
              An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to labels appearing in the channelBox.
        
          - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [query,edit]
              Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the
              -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The channel box
              will only display the (last) item contained in the selectionConnection object. If a NULL string () is specified, then
              the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of working on the active list.
        
          - mainObjectList : mol           (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of every object on the active list that is the same type as the object displayed in
              the top (main) section of the channel box.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - maxHeight : mh                 (int)           [query,edit]
              An optional flag which is used to limit the height of the channelBox.
        
          - maxWidth : mw                  (int)           [query,edit]
              An optional flag which is used to limit the width of the channelBox.
        
          - niceNames : nn                 (bool)          [query,edit]
              Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
              longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
              longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - nodeRegex : nr                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which node names should (potentially) have their attributes selected for
              foreground text coloring. If nodeRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*' for a regular expression. The
              same idea simultaneously applies to the flag attrRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this
              regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve Note: nodes in namespaces have regular expressions
              applied as though those nodes weren't in namespaces
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - outputObjectList : ool         (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of every OUTPUT node associated an object on the main object list that is of the
              same type as the node displayed in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
        
          - outputs : out                  (bool)          [query]
              Returns the items shown under the 'OUTPUTS' heading in the channel box.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - precision : pre                (int)           [query,edit]
              Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels.
              Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - select : s                     (bool)          [edit]
              Allows programmatic selection of items (nodes or plugs) in the channel box. Selection is equivalent to clicking the item
              with the mouse; therefore only items currently shown in the channel box can be selected this way.
        
          - selectedHistoryAttributes : sha (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the INPUT section of the channel box.
        
          - selectedMainAttributes : sma   (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the top section of the channel box.
        
          - selectedOutputAttributes : soa (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
        
          - selectedShapeAttributes : ssa  (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
        
          - shapeObjectList : sol          (bool)          [query]
              Returns a list of strings, the names of every shape associated with an object on the main object list that is of the
              same type as the object displayed in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
        
          - shapes : shp                   (bool)          [query]
              Returns the items shown under the 'SHAPES' heading in the channel box.
        
          - showNamespace : sn             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Controls whether or not the namespace of an object is displayed if the object is not in the root namespace.
        
          - showTransforms : st            (bool)          [query,edit]
              Controls whether this control will display transform attributes only, or all other attributes. False by default.
              Queried, returns a boolean.
        
          - speed : spd                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Controls the speed at which the attributes are changed based on the distance the mouse has been dragged.  Common
              settings for slow/medium/fast are 0.1/1.0/10.0 respectively.  The default is 1.0.
        
          - takeFocus : tf                 (bool)          [edit]
              causes the channel box to take over the keyboard focus, if it can.
        
          - update : u                     (bool)          [edit]
              This flag can be used to force an update of the channel box display, for example after changing a display preference.
        
          - useManips : mnp                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              When you click on a field or label in the channel box, the tool switches to a manipulator that can change that value if
              you drag in the 3d view.  This flag controls the kind of manips.  Allowed values are none(self-explanatory),
              invisible(you won't see anything, but dragging in the window will adjust any of the selected attributes), and
              standard(the same as invisible, except for scale, rotate, and translate, which will be represented by their usual
              manips.)
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - beginProgress : bp             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Only valid for the main progress barShows the main progress bar (normally in the Help Line). This is normally issued
              through MEL when a length computation is about to occur.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - endProgress : ep               (bool)          [edit]
              Only valid for the main progress barHides the progress bar. No other flags can be used at the same time. This is
              normally issued through MEL in response to the -ic/isCancelled flag being set or if the progress value reaches its
              maximum.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isCancelled : ic               (bool)          [query]
              Returns true if the user has tried to cancel the operation. Returns false otherwise.
        
          - isInterruptable : ii           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Only valid for the main progress barReturns true if the isCancelled flag should respond to attempts to cancel the
              operation. Setting this to true will add a note in the help line display message to the user indicating that they can
              cancel the operation.
        
          - isMainProgressBar : imp        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Determines whether this progressBar is used to show the progress of all basic operations such as Open/Save file.The main
              progressBar behaves very differently, in that it only shows itself when there is an ongoing basic operation.Defaults to
              false, and only one progress bar will be recognized as the mainone.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - maxValue : max                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The maximum or endingvalue of the progress indicator. If the progress value is greater than the -max/maxValue, the
              progress value will be set to the maximum. Default value is 100.
        
          - minValue : min                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The minimum or startingvalue of the progress indicator. If the progress value is less than the -min/minValue, the
              progress value will be set to the minimum. Default value is 0.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - progress : pr                  (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The amount of progress currently shown on the control. The value will always be between min and max. Default is equal to
              the minimum when the control is created.
        
          - status : st                    (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Only valid for the main progress barSets the contents of the helpLine control when the progressBar is showing. Use this
              instead of setting the helpLine directly because this will force a graphical refresh before returning.
        
          - step : s                       (int)           [edit]
              Increments the -pr/progress value by the amount specified.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - disableOnImage : dni           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

              diplayed in the window.
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfColumns : nc           (int)           [create,query,edit]

          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - numberOfRows : nr              (int)           [create,query,edit]
              A positive non-zero integer value indicating the number of rows in the grid layout.
        
          - numberOfRowsColumns : nrc      (int, int)      [create,edit]
              Two positive non-zero integer values for the number of rows and columns, respectively, in the grid layout.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - position : pos                 (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
              Specify the name of a child control in the grid layout along with a 1-based integer value indicating the desired
              position of the child.  Positions increase from left to right within a row and then wrap around to the next row
              increasing from top to bottom.  For example, a grid layout with 3 columns and 2 rows has 6 visible positions where 1, 2
              and 3 occupy the first row and 4, 5 and 6 occupy the second.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enable1 : en1                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - extraLabel : el                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label in the group.  Sets the string to be label text
              to the right of fields.

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's

Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

class AttrNavigationControlGrp(Layout):
    """
    class counterpart of mel function `attrNavigationControlGrp`
    
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged label navigation button. The group is used to help the user manage connections to a particular attribute. When creating the control you have the opportunity to attach scripts to the control that are executed on various UI events.  You can define what happens when the navigation button is pressed, and when a node is dragged and dropped onto this attribute. The navigation button can traverse to the connected node or can bring up UI to create new connections to the attribute. The button also can show you state information: if there already exists a connection/if the connection is ignored.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    This command creates a new window but leaves it invisible. It is most efficient to add the window's elements and then make it visible with the showWindow command. The window can have an optional menu bar. Also, the title bar and minimize/maximize buttons can be turned on or off. If the title bar is off, then you cannot have minimize or maximize buttons. Note: The window will require a control layout of some kind to arrange the controls (buttons, sliders, fields, etc.).  Examples of control layouts are columnLayout, formLayout, rowLayout, etc. Note: This command will clear the uiTemplate stack.  Templates for a window need to be set after the window cmd.

        This command creates a new window but leaves it invisible. It is most efficient to add the window's elements and then
        make it visible with the showWindow command. The window can have an optional menu bar. Also, the title bar and
        minimize/maximize buttons can be turned on or off. If the title bar is off, then you cannot have minimize or maximize
        buttons. Note: The window will require a control layout of some kind to arrange the controls (buttons, sliders, fields,
        etc.).  Examples of control layouts are columnLayout, formLayout, rowLayout, etc. Note: This command will clear the
        uiTemplate stack.  Templates for a window need to be set after the window cmd.
        
        Flags:
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,edit]
              The background color of the window. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - closeCommand : cc              (script)        [create,edit]

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              Specifies which docking areas occupied the four different corners of the window. By default docking windows on the
              bottom or top will span the whole window. Use multiple instances of this flag to allow the left and right docking areas
              to occupy the corners. This method has two arguments: docking corner and docking area. Possible values for docking
              corner are topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, and bottomRight. Possible values for docking area are left, right, top, and
              bottom.

          - dockingLayout : dl             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              When queried this flag will return a string holding the docking layout information. This string can be set when creating
              or editing a docking station to restore the previous docking layout. This string is a hexadecimal representation of a
              binary string and is not meant to be humanly readable, but can be saved and loaded using the optionVar command to
              restore layouts across sessions of Maya.

              Return a string array containing the names of the menus in the window's menu bar.
        
          - menuBar : mb                   (bool)          [create,query]
              Adds an empty menu bar to the window. The Qt name of the object will be m_menubar_nameOfTheWindow.
        
          - menuBarCornerWidget : mcw      (unicode, unicode) [query,edit]

              Specifies a parent window or layout which the created window is always on top of. Note: If the parent is a window the
              created window is not modal, so events are still propagated to the parent window.
        
          - resizeToFitChildren : rtf      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The window will always grow/shrink to just fit the controls it contains.

              When queried this flag will return a string holding the window state information. This string is a hexadecimal
              representation of a binary string and is not meant to be humanly readable, but can be saved and loaded using the
              optionVar command to restore window state across sessions of Maya.
        
          - title : t                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each

          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - ltVersion : lt                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              This flag is used to specify the Maya LT version that this control feature was introduced, if the version flag is not
              specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
              otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. 2014, 2015). Currently only
              accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2014.5 should be given as 2014).
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - position : pos                 (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
              Specify the name of a child control in the grid layout along with a 1-based integer value indicating the desired
              position of the child. Positions increase from left to right within a row and then wrap around to the next row
              increasing from top to bottom. For example, a grid layout with 3 columns and 2 rows has 6 visible positions where 1, 2
              and 3 occupy the first row and 4, 5 and 6 occupy the second.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - spacing : spa                  (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Sets the space between children.
        
          - style : st                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Set or query the current style of the items in the shelf.  Valid styles are iconOnly, textOnly, iconAndTextHorizontaland
              iconAndTextVertical.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - version : ver                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify the version that this feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version number
              (e.g. 2014, 2015). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2014.5 should be given as 2014).
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
              If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the
              -tx/textflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

              Enable state of the button.  By default, this flag is set to true and the button is enabled.  Specify true, and the
              button will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - insertText : it                (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).

              The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the
              field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - placeholderText : pht          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Setting this property makes the line edit display a grayed-out placeholder text as long as the text field is empty and
              the widget doesn't have focus. By default, this property contains an empty string.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment
              types and offsets for the entire row.
        
          - text : tx                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Text in the field.
        
          - textChangedCommand : tcc       (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed immediately when the field text changes.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

class FloatSliderGrp(Layout):
    """
    class counterpart of mel function `floatSliderGrp`
    
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.  To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command: floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.  If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y, modifiers.

        Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
        control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
        and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
        column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
        text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field range
        values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to
        enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.  To
        do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
        command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
        -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
        -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
        result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
        floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to
        select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.
        If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the
        slider as well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits
        will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to
        the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        This command creates a popup menu and attaches it to the current control if no parent is specified.  The popup menu is
        posted with the right mouse button by default. Popup menus can be added to any kind of control, however, on some
        widgets, only the standard menu button (3rd mouse button) can be used to trigger popup menus. This is to meet generally
        accepted UI guidelines that assign the 3rd mouse button and only this one to popup menus, and also to prevent unexpected
        behavior of controls like text fields, that expect 1st and 2nd button to be reserved for contextual operations like text
        or item selection...

              added to a menu that doesn't allow them.  This flag may be queried and must be specified when the popup menu is created.

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y, modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'

Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute.  This flag can be used to override that name with
              whatever the user wants.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rgbValue : rgb                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]

              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - preSelectCommand : psc         (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when a tab is selected but before it's contents become visible.  Re-selecting the current tab will not
              invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTabor
              -sti/selectTabIndexflags.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - scrollable : scr               (bool)          [create,query]

              If true, the active tab in the layout can be scrolled through with the mouse wheel. Default is true.
        
          - selectCommand : sc             (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command executed when a tab is selected interactively  This command will be invoked whenever a tab is selected, ie. re-
              selecting the current tab will invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the
              -st/selectTabor -sti/selectTabIndexflags.
        
          - selectTab : st                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The name, in short form, of the selected tab.  An empty string is returned on query if there are no child tabs.
        
          - selectTabIndex : sti           (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Identical to the -st/selectTabflag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the selected tab.  A value of 0 is
              returned on query if there are not child tabs.
        
          - showNewTab : snt               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Set to true if you want to have a 'New Tab' button shown at the end of the tab bar.  Note: use the
              -ntc/newTabCommandflag to set the command executed when this button is clicked.
        
          - tabLabel : tl                  (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
              Set a tab label.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second
              argument is the label for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab labels for all the
              children are returned.
        
          - tabLabelIndex : tli            (int, unicode)  [create,query,edit]
              Identical to the -tl/tabLabelflag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the label
              for. If this flag is queried the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        
          - tabsClosable : tc              (bool)          [create,query]
              Set to true if you want to have a close button icon on all created tabs.

          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - verticalScrollBarThickness : vst (int)           [create,edit]
              Thickness of the vertical scroll bar.  Specify an integer value greater than or equal to zero. This flag has no effect
              on Windows systems.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
              If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the
              -tx/textflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - insertText : it                (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
        
          - insertionPosition : ip         (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the
              field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

        Flags:
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - borderStyle : bs               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Specify the style of the border for tab layout. Valid values are: none, top, notopand full. By default, it will use
              fullto draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout. none- Do not draw borders around the body area of the
              tab layouttop- Only draw a simple line right below the tabsnotop- Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top)
              of the tab layoutfull- Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout
        
          - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-
              selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.
        
          - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
              Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        
          - childResizable : cr            (bool)          [create,query]
              Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a
              minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidthflag.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when a tab is double clicked on.  Note that the first click will select the tab and the second click
              will execute the double click command.  Double clicking the current tab will re-invoke the double click command.
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - horizontalScrollBarThickness : hst (int)           [create,edit]
              Thickness of the horizontal scroll bar.  Specify an integer value greater than or equal to zero. This flag has no effect
              on Windows systems.
        
          - image : i                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - innerMarginWidth : imw         (int)           [create,query]
              Margin width for all tab children.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - minChildWidth : mcw            (int)           [create,query]
              Specify a positive non-zero integer value indicating the minimum width the tab layout's children.  This flag only has
              meaning when the -cr/childResizableflag is set to true.

          - newTabCommand : ntc            (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when the 'New Tab' button (on the tab bar) is clicked.  Note: in order to show the new tab button use
              the -snt/showNewTabflag.  Using this command will override any internal Maya logic for adding a new tab (only this
              command will be executed).
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.

          - preSelectCommand : psc         (script)        [create,edit]
              Command executed when a tab is selected but before it's contents become visible.  Re-selecting the current tab will not
              invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTabor
              -sti/selectTabIndexflags.

          - showNewTab : snt               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Set to true if you want to have a 'New Tab' button shown at the end of the tab bar.  Note: use the
              -ntc/newTabCommandflag to set the command executed when this button is clicked.
        
          - tabLabel : tl                  (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
              Set a tab label.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second
              argument is the label for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab labels for all the
              children are returned.
        
          - tabLabelIndex : tli            (int, unicode)  [create,query,edit]
              Identical to the -tl/tabLabelflag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the label
              for. If this flag is queried the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        
          - tabsClosable : tc              (bool)          [create,query]
              Set to true if you want to have a close button icon on all created tabs.

          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - verticalScrollBarThickness : vst (int)           [create,edit]
              Thickness of the vertical scroll bar.  Specify an integer value greater than or equal to zero. This flag has no effect
              on Windows systems.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

class FormLayout(Layout):
    """
    class counterpart of mel function `formLayout`
    
    This command creates a form layout control. A form layout allows absolute and relative positioning of the controls that are its immediate children. Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3 leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:Avoid making control attachments that form a loop in control dependencies. For example: window; string $form = `formLayout`; string $btn1 = `button`; string $btn2 = `button`; string $btn3 = `button`;formLayout -edit-attachControl $btn2 top2 $btn1-attachControl $btn3 top2 $btn2-attachControl $btn1 right2 $btn3 $form;showWindow; $btn2 is attached to $btn1, $btn3 is attached to $btn2, and $btn1 is attached to $btn3. Thus, the placement of $btn1 is dependent on the placement of $btn3, which is dependent on the placement of $btn2, which is dependent on the placement of $btn1. The last control attachment will have created a loop in the dependencies. To prevent runtime errors, Maya will ignore this attachment and instead issue a warning that a cyclical control attachment has been detected in the script.

        This command creates a form layout control. A form layout allows absolute and relative positioning of the controls that
        are its immediate children. Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that
        children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the
        argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six
        ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3
        leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an
        edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge
        of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side
        of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a
        fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a
        percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will
        determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is
        no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in
        each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate
        child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of
        divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a
        measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in
        pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:Avoid making control
        attachments that form a loop in control dependencies. For example: window; string $form = `formLayout`; string $btn1 =
        `button`; string $btn2 = `button`; string $btn3 = `button`;formLayout -edit-attachControl $btn2 top2 $btn1-attachControl
        $btn3 top2 $btn2-attachControl $btn1 right2 $btn3 $form;showWindow; $btn2 is attached to $btn1, $btn3 is attached to
        $btn2, and $btn1 is attached to $btn3. Thus, the placement of $btn1 is dependent on the placement of $btn3, which is
        dependent on the placement of $btn2, which is dependent on the placement of $btn1. The last control attachment will have
        created a loop in the dependencies. To prevent runtime errors, Maya will ignore this attachment and instead issue a
        warning that a cyclical control attachment has been detected in the script.
        
        Flags:
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - attachControl : ac             (unicode, unicode, int, unicode) [create,edit]
              Arguments are: control, edge, offset, control Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to
              another control.

              Arguments are: control, edge, offset. Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach the specified control to
              the form, offset by the specified amount.
        
          - attachNone : an                (unicode, unicode) [create,edit]
              Arguments are: control, edge Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to nothing.
        
          - attachOppositeControl : aoc    (unicode, unicode, int, unicode) [create,edit]
              Arguments are: control, edge, offset, control Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to the
              opposite side of another control.
        
          - attachOppositeForm : aof       (unicode, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are: control, edge, offset. Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to the opposite
              side of the form.
        
          - attachPosition : ap            (unicode, unicode, int, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are: control, edge, offset, position Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to a
              position in the form.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
              Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfDivisions : nd         (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Specify the number of horizontal and vertical divisions across the form. Value must be greater than 0.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        view the hidden controls. Since the scroll layout provides no real positioning of children you should use another

              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]

              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.

              Sets the children of the layout to be attached on both sides. They will stretch or shrink with the layout.
        
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
              Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        
          - columnAlign : cal              (unicode)       [create,edit]
              Sets the alignment of children containing text or pixmaps. Align values: left| right| center.
        
          - columnAttach : cat             (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
              Sets the attachment and offsets for the children of the layout.  Side values: left| right| both.  Left or both is
              recommended.
        
          - columnOffset : co              (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
              Sets the offsets for children of the layout. Side values: left| right| both.
        
          - columnWidth : cw               (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Sets the width of the column.  Unless the children are attached to both sides of the column, the width cannot be
              enforced. Larger children will expand layout.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rowSpacing : rs                (int)           [create,query,edit]
              Sets the space between children.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports the notion of a larger secondary range of possible field values. If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max values defined in the attribute.  The user-specified values can reduce the min and max, but cannot expand them. The field created here is an expression field -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the character =.  This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the slider. The field also has an automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button. The contents of this menu change depending on the state of the attribute being watched by the field.

        All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each

        column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and
        float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports the notion of a larger secondary range of
        possible field values. If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max values defined in
        the attribute.  The user-specified values can reduce the min and max, but cannot expand them. The field created here is
        an expression field -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the
        character =.  This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the slider. The field also has an
        automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button. The contents of this menu change depending on the state of the

              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute.  This flag can be used to override that name with

              Sets the minimum value for both the slider and the field. (by default max and min are set according to what is in the
              attribute, if anything.  If no max and min are specified, or if only one of the two are specified, then no slider is
              created.)
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]

              and cannot be overridden.)
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment
              types and offsets for the entire row.

              Set the minimum value for the slider.  The slider min will be clipped to the field min.
        
          - sliderStep : ss                (float)         [create,query,edit]
              On Linux the slider step value represents the amount the value will increase or decrease when you click either side of
              the slider.
        
          - step : s                       (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Sets the increment for both the slider and float field.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
        control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - enumeratedItem : ei            (int, unicode)  [create]
              Enumerated item and the corresponding string. If this flag is not supplied when the control is created, then the command
              will try to read the values from the attribute.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfColumns : nc           (int)           [create,query]
              Number of columns in the row.  The specified number of columns must be a value greater than 0.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Vertically attach a particular column.  The first argument is a 1-based index specifying the column.  The second
              argument is the attachment, valid values are top, bottom, and both.  The third argument is the offset value.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]

          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    This command creates a rowColumn layout. A rowColumn layout positions children in either a row or column format. A column layout, specified with the -nc/numberOfColumnsflag, allows you set text alignment, attachments and offsets for each column in the layout. Every member of a column will have the same alignment, attachment and offsets.  Likewise the row format, specified by the -nr/numberOfRowsflag, allows setting of these attributes for each row in the layout. Every member of a row will have the same attributes. The layout must be either a row or column format. This layout does not support both, or the specification of attributes on an individual child basis. Some flags only make sense for one of either the row format or the column format.  For example the -rh/rowHeightflag can only be specified in row format. In column format the row height is determined by the tallest child in the row, plus offsets.

        This command creates a rowColumn layout. A rowColumn layout positions children in either a row or column format. A
        column layout, specified with the -nc/numberOfColumnsflag, allows you set text alignment, attachments and offsets for
        each column in the layout. Every member of a column will have the same alignment, attachment and offsets.  Likewise the
        row format, specified by the -nr/numberOfRowsflag, allows setting of these attributes for each row in the layout. Every
        member of a row will have the same attributes. The layout must be either a row or column format. This layout does not
        support both, or the specification of attributes on an individual child basis. Some flags only make sense for one of
        either the row format or the column format.  For example the -rh/rowHeightflag can only be specified in row format. In
        column format the row height is determined by the tallest child in the row, plus offsets.
        
        Flags:
          - adjustableColumn : adj         (int)           []
        
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
              Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        
          - columnAlign : cal              (int, unicode)  [create,edit]
              Alignment for text and pixmaps in the specified column.  Values are: left, rightand center.  Only valid for column
              format, ie. number of columns specified with -nc/numberOfColumnsflag.
        
          - columnAttach : cat             (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              The attachements and offsets for the children in the specified column.  The first argument is the 1-based column index.
              The second argument is the attachment, valid values are left, rightand both.  The third argument must be greater than 0
              and specifies the offset.
        
          - columnOffset : co              (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              The attachment offset for the specified column.  The first argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument is
              the attachment, valid values are left, rightand both.  The third argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the
              offset.
        
          - columnSpacing : cs             (int, int)      [create,edit]
              The space between columns in pixels.  In column format this flag specifies that the space be to the left of the given
              column.  In row format it specifies the space between all columns, however a valid column index is still required.  The
              first argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the spacing.
        
          - columnWidth : cw               (int, int)      [create,edit]
              Width of a column. This flag is valid only in column format.  The column width must be greater than 0.  The first
              argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the column width.
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.

              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    class counterpart of mel function `attrFieldGrp`
    
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, plus two to four float fields.  These fields will be attached to the specified vector attribute, so that changes in either will be reflected in the other. The fields created here are expression fields -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the character -. The field also has an automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button.  The contents of this menu change depending on the state of the attribute being watched by the field.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.
        
          - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
              Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        
          - extraButton : eb               (bool)          [create]
              Add an extra icon button to the end of this control (before extra label).
        
          - extraButtonCommand : ebc       (script)        [create,edit]
              The command string is executed when the extra button is clicked.
        
          - extraButtonIcon : ebi          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The icon file name of the extra button.
        
          - extraLabel : el                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              set an optional string that will be positioned to the right of all the fields.
        
          - forceAddMapButton : fmb        (bool)          [create]
              Force adding a map button to this control. If this option is true, option hideMapButton is suppressed.
        
          - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
              Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
        
          - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
              Sets the maximum value for all fields.

              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfFields : nf            (int)           [create]
              sets the number of fields.  Only allowed values are 2 to 4.  If not specified, defaults to 3.  NOTE: if the -at flag is
              used when this widget is created, the number of children in the attribute will determine the number of fields.  Also
              note:  after creation, the number of fields cannot be changed with the -e flag.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]

              Sets the precision for all fields
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
              Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment
              types and offsets for the entire row.

              Sets the increment for all fields
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

class IntSliderGrp(Layout):
    """
    class counterpart of mel function `intSliderGrp`
    
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.  To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command: intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.  If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

        All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
        control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
        and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
        column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
        text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field
        range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you
        to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.
        To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
        command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
        -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
        -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
        result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
        intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select
        any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.  If you
        enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as
        well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits will
        never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the
        field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160. TelfBaseGrpCmd.cpp

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
              The command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.

The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

        only two children, one on top of the other and a visible separator between the two.  The separator may be moved to vary

        Flags:
          - activeFrameThickness : aft     (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The thickness of the frame drawn around the active frame. Specify an integer value greater than or equal to 0.
        
          - activePane : ap                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The active pane has a colored border surrounding it.  Only one pane may be active at any one time.  Using either of the
              flags -ap/activePaneor -api/activePaneIndexwill automatically deactivate the previously active pane.  The argument is
              the full or short name of the child control.
        
          - activePaneIndex : api          (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The active pane index.  The active pane has a colored border surrounding it.  Only one pane may be active at any one
              time.  Using either of the flags -ap/activePaneor -api/activePaneIndexwill automatically deactivate the previously
              active pane.  The argument is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered
              clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.  If any other index is specified then the
              current active pane is deactivated.
        
          - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        
          - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
              enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        
          - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
              Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        
          - configuration : cn             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Set the layout configuration for the panes.  Valid values are: single, horizontal2, vertical2, horizontal3, vertical3,
              top3, left3, bottom3, right3, horizontal4, vertical4, top4, left4, bottom4, right4, quad
        
          - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
              Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
              argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
              as the current template.
        
          - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
              render/multiLister/createNode/material
        
          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

              The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        
          - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
              The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
              component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        
          - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
              Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - numberOfVisiblePanes : nvp     (bool)          [query]

              Return the name of the control in the respective pane.
        
          - paneSize : ps                  (int, int, int) [create,query,edit]
              The size of a pane in the current pane layout configuration.  The first argument specifies the pane index and is an
              integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered clockwise beginning with the
              pane in the top left corner of the layout.  The width and height of the pane are specified by the last two arguments.
              Both are integer values and they indicate the percentage of the total pane layout size rather that the number of pixels.
        
          - paneUnderPointer : pup         (bool)          [query]
              Return the name of the child occupying the pane that the pointer is currently over.  An empty string is returned if the
              pointer is not over a pane.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - separatorMovedCommand : smc    (script)        [create,edit]
              This command executed when the pane separators are moved.
        
          - separatorThickness : st        (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The thickness of the separators between the panes. Specify an integer value greater than 0. This flag has no effect on
              Windows systems.
        
          - setPane : sp                   (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
              This flag allows you to put a child of this layout in a particular pane.  The first argument is the full or short name
              of the control.  The second argument is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration
              are numbered clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.
        
          - staticHeightPane : shp         (int)           [create,edit]
              Set a pane to have a static height, i.e. its height will not change when the layout is dynamically resized. Only one
              pane can be set to have a static height at one time. This state will be retained even if another child is switched into
              the pane. Specify 0 to set a pane back to the default state. Any state will be lost if the pane configuration is
              changed.
        
          - staticWidthPane : swp          (int)           [create,edit]
              Set a pane to have a static width, i.e. its width will not change when the layout is dynamically resized. Only one pane
              can be set to have a static width at one time. This state will be retained even if another child is switched into the
              pane. Specify 0 to set a pane back to the default state. Any state will be lost if the pane configuration is changed.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

              Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
              it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
              window is invisible or iconified.
        
          - itemListLong : ill             (bool)          [query]

          - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
              background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        
          - numberOfItems : ni             (bool)          [query]
              The number of menu items.
        
          - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
              Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
              The parent layout for this control.
        
          - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
              Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        
          - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        
          - select : sl                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The current menu item.  The argument and return value is 1-based.  Note that the current menu item can only be set if it
              is enabled.
        
          - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
              Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        
          - value : v                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
              The text of the current menu item.
        
          - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
              also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        
          - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
              Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        
          - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
              The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
              Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, option menu and an extra label.  Both the label and extra label are optional. Subsequent calls to the menuItem command will place them in the option menu.  When adding menu items to the option menu after the initialization step, use the name of the options menu itself. See the example below for more details. Note that commands attached to menu items will not get called. Use the -cc/changedCommandflag to be notified when the user changes the value of the option menu.

          - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
              global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
              is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
              Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
              CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
              but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
              argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
              values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
              Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
              standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
              modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
        
          - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
              Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
              callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
              $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
              array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
              $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
              the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
              callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
              these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
              specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
              Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
              x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
              '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
        
          - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
              the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        
          - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
              Enables the background color of the control.

              Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
              controls are created managed by default.
        
          - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
              Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

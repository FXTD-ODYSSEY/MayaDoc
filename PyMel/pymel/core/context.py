    This command allows a user to create their own tools based on the selection tool. A number of selection lists can be
    collected, the behaviour of the selection and the selection masks are fully customizable, etc. The command is processed
    prior to being executed.  The keyword $Selection#where # is a number 1 or greater specifies a selection set.  The
    context can specify several selection sets which are substituted in place of the $Selection# keyword in the form of a
    Mel string array.  Items that are specific per set need to be specified in each set, if they are going to be specified
    for any of the sets.  See examples below. In addition, in order to specify the type of selection you need to be making,
    any of the selection type flags from selectTypecommand can be used here.
    
    Flags:
      - allComponents : alc            (bool)          [create,query]

          The default is scriptTool.

          If set, the selection lists will be cumulative.  For example, the second list will contain all the items from the first
          list, the third all the items from the second list etc.  Make sure your script specified above takes that into account.
          Relevant if there is more than one selection set.

          Returns true or false depending upon whether the specified object exists. Other flags are ignored.
    
      - exitUponCompletion : euc       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If set, completing the last selection set will exit the tool.  Default is true.
    
      - expandSelectionList : esl      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If set, the selection lists will expand to have a single component in each item.  You probably want this as a default,
          otherwise two isoparms on the same surface will show up as 1 item. To ensure that components on the same object are
          returned in the order in which they are selected, use the selectPref -trackSelectionOrder oncommand in your
          -toolStartscript to enable ordered selection, then restore it to its original value in your -toolFinishscript.
    
      - facet : fc                     (bool)          [create,query]

          number of selection sets you have, the script can make use of variables string $Selection1[], $Selection2[], ...
    
      - fluid : fl                     (bool)          [create,query]
          Set fluid selection mask on/off. (object flag)

      - forceAddSelect : fas           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If set to true, together with -setAutoToggleSelection (see below) on the first selection set, causes the first selection
          after the computation of the previous result to be shiftselection, unless a modifier key is pressed.  Default is false.
          Flags for each selection set.  These flags are multi-use.
    
      - hairSystem : hs                (bool)          [create,query]

      - hull : hl                      (bool)          [create,query]
          Set hull selection mask on/off. (component flag)
    
      - ignoreInvalidItems : iii       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If you have multiple selection sets, the state of the selection set is recorded at the time you complete it.  You could
          then delete some of the items in that list and end up with invalid items in one or more of your selection sets.  If this
          flag is set, those items will be detected and ignored.  You will never know it happened.  Its as if they were never
          selected in the first place, except that your selection set now does not have as many items as it may need.  If this
          flag is not set, you will get a warning and your final command callback script will likely not execute because of an
          error condition.

    This is a context command to set the flags on the artAttrContext, which is the base context for attribute painting

"""
Current Features
----------------

tab completion of depend nodes, dag nodes, and attributes
automatic import of pymel

Future Features
---------------

- tab completion of PyNode attributes
- color coding of tab complete options
    - to differentiate between methods and attributes
    - dag nodes vs depend nodes
    - shortNames vs longNames
- magic commands
- bookmarking of maya's recent project and files

To Use
------

place in your PYTHONPATH
add the following line to the 'main' function of $HOME/.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py::

    import ipymel

    Change the current working directory.
    
    This command automatically maintains an internal list of directories
    you visit during your IPython session, in the variable _sh. The
    command %dhist shows this history nicely formatted. You can also
    do 'cd -<tab>' to see directory history conveniently.
    
    Usage:
    
      openFile 'dir': changes to directory 'dir'.
    
      openFile -: changes to the last visited directory.
    
      openFile -<n>: changes to the n-th directory in the directory history.
    
      openFile --foo: change to directory that matches 'foo' in history
    
      openFile -b <bookmark_name>: jump to a bookmark set by %bookmark
         (note: cd <bookmark_name> is enough if there is no
          directory <bookmark_name>, but a bookmark with the name exists.)
          'cd -b <tab>' allows you to tab-complete bookmark names.
    
    Options:
    
    -q: quiet.  Do not print the working directory after the cd command is
    executed.  By default IPython's cd command does print this directory,
    since the default prompts do not display path information.
    
    Note that !cd doesn't work for this purpose because the shell where
    !command runs is immediately discarded after executing 'command'.
